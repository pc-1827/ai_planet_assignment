Problem Statement**\n\nFind the number of complex numbers $z$ among the $24^{th}$ roots of unity (solutions to $z^{24}=1$) such that $z^6$ is a real number.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $z^{24} = 1$: $z$ is a $24^{th}$ root of unity.\n- $z^6 \\in \\mathbb{R}$: $z^6$ is a real number.\n- We need to count how many such $z$ exist among the $24$ roots of unity.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will first express the $24^{th}$ roots of unity in exponential form. Then we will find the condition for $z^6$ to be a real number and count how many roots satisfy this condition.\nAlternatively, we can consider the possible values of $z^6$ if $z^{24}=1$ and $z^6$ is real.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- The $n^{th}$ roots of unity are given by $z_k = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi k}{n}}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1$.\n- A complex number $w$ is real if and only if its imaginary part is zero, or equivalently, if $w = \\bar{w}$, or if $\\arg(w) = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n- Euler's formula: $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nThe $24^{th}$ roots of unity are given by $z_k = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi k}{24}}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 23$.\nSimplifying the exponent, we have $z_k = e^{i \\frac{\\pi k}{12}}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 23$.\nNow consider $z_k^6$:\n$z_k^6 = \\left(e^{i \\frac{\\pi k}{12}}\\right)^6 = e^{i \\frac{6\\pi k}{12}} = e^{i \\frac{\\pi k}{2}}$.\n\nFor $z_k^6$ to be a real number, its imaginary part must be zero. Using Euler's formula, we have:\n$z_k^6 = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{2}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{2}\\right)$.\nFor $z_k^6$ to be real, we need $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{2}\\right) = 0$.\nThis occurs when $\\frac{\\pi k}{2} = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get $\\frac{k}{2} = n$, or $k = 2n$.\nThis means $k$ must be an even integer.\n\nWe need to count the number of even integers $k$ in the range $0 \\le k \\le 23$.\nThe even integers in this range are $0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22$.\nTo count them, we can express even numbers as $2n$. We need to find the range of integers $n$ such that $0 \\le 2n \\le 23$.\nDividing by 2, we get $0 \\le n \\le \\frac{23}{2} = 11.5$.\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the possible values for $n$ are $0, 1, 2, ..., 11$.\nThe number of possible values for $n$ is $11 - 0 + 1 = 12$.\nThus, there are 12 even values of $k$ in the range $0 \\le k \\le 23$.\nFor each of these even values of $k$, $z_k^6$ is a real number.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that $w = z^6$. Since $z^{24}=1$, we have $(z^6)^4 = 1$, so $w^4 = 1$. The solutions for $w^4=1$ are $w = 1, -1, i, -i$.\nWe need $z^6 = w$ to be a real number, so $w$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\nIf $z^6 = 1$, there are $6$ distinct solutions for $z$.\nIf $z^6 = -1$, there are $6$ distinct solutions for $z$.\nThese two sets of solutions are disjoint.\nTherefore, the total number of solutions is $6 + 6 = 12$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe number of complex numbers $z$ for which $z^{24}=1$ and $z^6$ is a real number is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nVerification:\nWe found that there are 12 even values of $k$ from 0 to 23. For each even $k$, $z_k^6 = e^{i \\frac{\\pi k}{2}}$ is real. For example, if $k=0$, $z_0^6 = e^0 = 1$ (real). If $k=2$, $z_2^6 = e^{i \\pi} = -1$ (real). If $k=1$, $z_1^6 = e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{2}} = i$ (not real).\nOur count of 12 matches both methods used. The condition $k$ being even is necessary and sufficient for $z_k^6$ to be real. There are 12 even integers in the range $0 \\le k \\le 23$.",
