    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nThe function $f$ has the property that for each real number $x$ in its domain, $1/x$ is also in its domain, and it satisfies the equation $f(x) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = x$. We need to determine the largest set of real numbers that can be in the domain of $f$.\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- Function $f$\n- Domain of $f$ must satisfy: if $x$ is in the domain, then $1/x$ is also in the domain.\n- Functional equation: $f(x) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain.\n\n## Solution Strategy\nWe will use the given functional equation and the domain constraint to deduce the possible values of $x$ that can be in the domain of $f$. We will substitute $1/x$ for $x$ in the functional equation to obtain a second equation. By comparing these two equations, we will find the restrictions on $x$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Start with the given functional equation:**\n   \\[\n   f(x) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = x \\quad (*)\n   \\]\n   This equation holds for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.\n\n2. **Use the domain property:**\n   If $x$ is in the domain, then $1/x$ is also in the domain. Therefore, we can replace $x$ with $1/x$ in the functional equation $(*)$, provided that $x \\ne 0$.\n   \\[\n   f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{1/x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\quad (**)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare equations (*) and (**):**\n   We have two equations:\n   (*) $f(x) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = x$\n   (**) $f(x) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x}$\n\n   Since the left-hand sides of equations (*) and (**) are the same, the right-hand sides must also be equal for the equations to hold simultaneously for a given $x$.\n   Therefore, we must have:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{x}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for x:**\n   Multiply both sides by $x$ (assuming $x \\ne 0$, which is required for $1/x$ to be defined):\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 1\n   \\]\n   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\pm 1\n   \\]\n   So, the only possible values for $x$ that can satisfy both equations are $x = 1$ and $x = -1$.\n\n5. **Check if the set ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$ is a valid domain:**\n   If $x=1$, then $1/x = 1$, which is in the set ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$.\n   If $x=-1$, then $1/x = -1$, which is in the set ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$.\n   Thus, for any $x$ in ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$, $1/x$ is also in ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$. So, the domain condition is satisfied.\n\n   For $x=1$, the equation becomes $f(1) + f(1/1) = 1 \\implies 2f(1) = 1 \\implies f(1) = 1/2$.\n   For $x=-1$, the equation becomes $f(-1) + f(1/-1) = -1 \\implies 2f(-1) = -1 \\implies f(-1) = -1/2$.\n   We can define a function $f$ on the domain ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$ such that $f(1) = 1/2$ and $f(-1) = -1/2$, and the given condition is satisfied.\n\n6. **Verify that ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$ is the largest possible set:**\n   We have shown that if $x$ is in the domain, then $x$ must satisfy $x = 1/x$, which leads to $x = 1$ or $x = -1$. Therefore, the domain cannot contain any other real numbers besides $1$ and $-1$. Hence, ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$ is the largest possible set for the domain of $f$.\n\n7. **Compare with the options:**\n   The set ${\\{-1, 1\\}}$ corresponds to option (e).\n\n## Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(e)}$",
