    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n### 1. Problem Statement\nWe are asked to find the value of the sum of the series:\n$$-1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 - 7 +\\dots+ 10,\\!000$$\nThis is an alternating sum of the first 10,000 positive integers, where odd integers are subtracted and even integers are added.\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- The series is an alternating sum.\n- The terms are consecutive integers from 1 to 10,000.\n- The sign of the $n$-th term is $(-1)^n$.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe can solve this problem by grouping consecutive terms in pairs and observing a pattern. Alternatively, we can separate the series into two arithmetic series: one with positive terms and one with negative terms, and then sum each series separately. We will use the pairing method as it is more straightforward for this problem.\n\n**Relevant Formulas/Theorems:**\n- Sum of an arithmetic series (not directly needed for the pairing method, but useful for the alternative approach).\n- Basic arithmetic operations.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nWe group the terms in pairs:\n$$(-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + (-5 + 6) + (-7 + 8) + \\dots$$\nWe need to determine the last pair. Since the series goes up to 10,000, and we are pairing consecutive terms, the last pair will involve the terms $-9999$ and $+10000$. So the last pair is $(-9999 + 10000)$.\n\nLet's rewrite the sum using these pairs:\n$$S = (-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + (-5 + 6) + \\dots + (-9999 + 10000)$$\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of each pair:\n$$(-1 + 2) = 1$$\n$$(-3 + 4) = 1$$\n$$(-5 + 6) = 1$$\n$$(-7 + 8) = 1$$\n$$\\dots$$\n$$(-9999 + 10000) = 1$$\n\nEach pair sums to 1. We need to find the number of pairs.\nSince we are pairing consecutive terms from 1 to 10,000, the number of pairs is half the total number of terms, which is $10,\\!000 / 2 = 5,\\!000$.\n\nSince each of the 5,000 pairs sums to 1, the total sum $S$ is the number of pairs multiplied by the sum of each pair:\n$$S = 5,\\!000 \\times 1 = 5,\\!000$$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the series is $5,\\!000$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe value of the sum $-1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 - 7 +\\dots+ 10,\\!000$ is $\\boxed{5000}$.\n\n**Verification:**\nWe checked the pattern for the first few terms and sums and observed a consistent behavior. Grouping the terms in pairs simplified the problem significantly, showing that each pair sums to 1. With 10,000 terms, there are exactly 5,000 pairs. Thus, the total sum is $5,000 \\times 1 = 5,000$. The answer satisfies all conditions and constraints of the problem.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{5000}$",
