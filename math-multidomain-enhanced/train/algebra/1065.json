    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nGiven two real numbers $a$ and $b$, we are provided with two conditions:\n- The sum of $a$ and $b$ is 7: $a+b=7$.\n- The sum of the cubes of $a$ and $b$ is 91: $a^3+b^3=91$.\n\nThe problem asks us to compute the product of $a$ and $b$, which is $ab$.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will use the algebraic identity for the sum of cubes:\n$a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$.\nWe also know that $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$, which can be rearranged to express $a^2+b^2$ in terms of $(a+b)$ and $ab$:\n$a^2+b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab$.\nSubstitute this expression for $a^2+b^2$ into the sum of cubes identity to express $a^3+b^3$ in terms of $(a+b)$ and $ab$.\nThen, we will substitute the given values of $a+b$ and $a^3+b^3$ into the equation and solve for $ab$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nGiven equations are:\n1. $a+b = 7$\n2. $a^3+b^3 = 91$\n\nWe use the identity for the sum of cubes:\n$a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$\n\nWe rewrite $a^2-ab+b^2$ using $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$:\n$a^2-ab+b^2 = (a^2+2ab+b^2) - 3ab = (a+b)^2 - 3ab$\n\nSubstitute this back into the sum of cubes identity:\n$a^3+b^3 = (a+b)((a+b)^2 - 3ab)$\n\nNow substitute the given values $a+b=7$ and $a^3+b^3=91$ into the equation:\n$91 = (7)((7)^2 - 3ab)$\n$91 = 7(49 - 3ab)$\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n$\\frac{91}{7} = 49 - 3ab$\n$13 = 49 - 3ab$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $ab$:\n$3ab = 49 - 13$\n$3ab = 36$\n$ab = \\frac{36}{3}$\n$ab = 12$\n\nTo verify our answer, we can find the values of $a$ and $b$. Since $a+b=7$ and $ab=12$, $a$ and $b$ are roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = 0$, which is $x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0$.\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-3)(x-4) = 0$.\nThus, the roots are $x=3$ and $x=4$. Let $a=3$ and $b=4$.\nThen $a+b = 3+4 = 7$, and $a^3+b^3 = 3^3+4^3 = 27+64 = 91$.\nBoth conditions are satisfied.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$",
