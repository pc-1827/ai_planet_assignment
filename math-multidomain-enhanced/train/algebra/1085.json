    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\nDetermine which of the given functions have inverses, considering their specified domains. A function has an inverse if and only if it is injective (one-to-one) on its domain. We need to check the injectivity of each function A through H.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nFor each function, we will analyze its monotonicity by examining its derivative or by considering its properties on the given domain. If a function is strictly monotonic (strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) on its domain, then it is injective and has an inverse. If we can find two distinct values in the domain that map to the same value in the range, then the function is not injective and does not have an inverse.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**A. $a(x) = \\sqrt{2 - x},$ $x \\in (-\\infty,2].$**\n$a'(x) = -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2 - x}}.$ For $x < 2,$ $a'(x) < 0.$ Thus, $a(x)$ is strictly decreasing on $(-\\infty,2).$ Since $a(x)$ is continuous on $(-\\infty,2],$ it is strictly decreasing on $(-\\infty,2].$ Therefore, $a(x)$ is injective and has an inverse.\n\n**B. $b(x) = x^3 - x,$ $x \\in \\mathbb{R}.$**\n$b'(x) = 3x^2 - 1.$ $b'(x) = 0$ at $x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}.$ $b'(0) = -1 < 0,$ $b'(1) = 2 > 0.$ Since the derivative changes sign, $b(x)$ is not monotonic on $\\mathbb{R}.$ We found $b(0) = b(1) = 0,$ so $b(x)$ is not injective and does not have an inverse.\n\n**C. $c(x) = x + \\frac{1}{x},$ $x \\in (0,\\infty).$**\n$c'(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2}.$ $c'(x) = 0$ at $x = 1.$ $c'(0.5) = 1 - \\frac{1}{0.25} = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0,$ $c'(2) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} > 0.$ Since the derivative changes sign, $c(x)$ is not monotonic on $(0,\\infty).$ We found $c(2) = c(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{5}{2},$ so $c(x)$ is not injective and does not have an inverse.\n\n**D. $d(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 7,$ $x \\in [0,\\infty).$**\n$d'(x) = 4x + 4 = 4(x + 1).$ For $x \\in [0,\\infty),$ $d'(x) > 0.$ Thus, $d(x)$ is strictly increasing on $[0,\\infty).$ Therefore, $d(x)$ is injective and has an inverse.\n\n**E. $e(x) = |x - 2| + |x + 3|,$ $x \\in \\mathbb{R}.$**\nFor $-3 \\le x \\le 2,$ $e(x) = 5.$ Since $e(x)$ is constant on an interval, it is not injective and does not have an inverse.\n\n**F. $f(x) = 3^x + 7^x,$ $x \\in \\mathbb{R}.$**\n$f'(x) = 3^x \\ln 3 + 7^x \\ln 7 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}.$ Thus, $f(x)$ is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}.$ Therefore, $f(x)$ is injective and has an inverse.\n\n**G. $g(x) = x - \\frac{1}{x},$ $x \\in (0,\\infty).$**\n$g'(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x^2} > 0$ for all $x \\in (0,\\infty).$ Thus, $g(x)$ is strictly increasing on $(0,\\infty).$ Therefore, $g(x)$ is injective and has an inverse.\n\n**H. $h(x) = \\frac{x}{2},$ $x \\in [-2,7).$**\n$h'(x) = \\frac{1}{2} > 0$ for all $x \\in [-2,7).$ Thus, $h(x)$ is strictly increasing on $[-2,7).$ Therefore, $h(x)$ is injective and has an inverse.\n\nThe functions that have inverses are A, D, F, G, H.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nThe functions that have inverses are A, D, F, G, H.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{A, D, F, G, H}",
