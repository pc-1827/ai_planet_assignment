    "solution": "### 1. **Problem Statement**\nFind the number of ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ where $x, y, z$ are real numbers such that they satisfy the following system of equations:\n$$x + y = 2$$\n$$xy - z^2 = 1$$\nThe key variables are $x, y, z$, and they must be real numbers. The constraints are given by the two equations above.\n\n### 2. **Solution Strategy**\nWe will use substitution to solve this system of equations.\nFirst, we will express one variable in terms of another from the first equation.\nThen, we will substitute this expression into the second equation to reduce the number of variables.\nFinally, we will analyze the resulting equation to find the possible values of the variables and count the number of ordered triples $(x,y,z)$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Substitution method for solving systems of equations.\n- Properties of real numbers and squares of real numbers (non-negativity).\n\n### 3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n**Step 1:** From the first equation, express $y$ in terms of $x$.\nGiven the first equation:\n$$x + y = 2$$\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n$$y = 2 - x$$\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute the expression for $y$ into the second equation.\nGiven the second equation:\n$$xy - z^2 = 1$$\nSubstitute $y = 2 - x$ into the second equation:\n$$x(2 - x) - z^2 = 1$$\n\n**Step 3:** Simplify and rearrange the equation to isolate $z^2$.\nExpanding the term $x(2 - x)$, we get:\n$$2x - x^2 - z^2 = 1$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $z^2$:\n$$z^2 = 2x - x^2 - 1$$\n\n**Step 4:** Factor the expression for $z^2$.\nWe can factor out a $-1$ from the right side and complete the square or recognize a perfect square trinomial:\n$$z^2 = -(x^2 - 2x + 1)$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2$.\nSo, we have:\n$$z^2 = -(x - 1)^2$$\n\n**Step 5:** Analyze the possible values for $x$ and $z$ based on the properties of real numbers.\nSince $z$ is a real number, $z^2 \\ge 0$.\nSince $x$ is a real number, $(x - 1)$ is a real number, so $(x - 1)^2 \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, $-(x - 1)^2 \\le 0$.\n\nWe have $z^2 = -(x - 1)^2$. For this equality to hold, since $z^2 \\ge 0$ and $-(x - 1)^2 \\le 0$, both sides must be equal to zero.\nThus, we must have:\n$$z^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -(x - 1)^2 = 0$$\n\n**Step 6:** Solve for $x$ and $z$.\nFrom $-(x - 1)^2 = 0$, we have $(x - 1)^2 = 0$, which implies $x - 1 = 0$, so $x = 1$.\nFrom $z^2 = 0$, we have $z = 0$.\n\n**Step 7:** Solve for $y$ using the equation $y = 2 - x$.\nSubstitute $x = 1$ into $y = 2 - x$:\n$$y = 2 - 1 = 1$$\n\n**Step 8:** Verify the solution $(x, y, z) = (1, 1, 0)$ in the original equations.\nEquation 1: $x + y = 1 + 1 = 2$. This is satisfied.\nEquation 2: $xy - z^2 = (1)(1) - (0)^2 = 1 - 0 = 1$. This is satisfied.\n\n**Step 9:** Count the number of ordered triples.\nWe found only one solution $(x, y, z) = (1, 1, 0)$. Since the conditions led to unique values for $x, y, z$, there is exactly one ordered triple that satisfies the given equations.\n\n### 4. **Final Answer**\nThe number of ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of real numbers such that $x + y = 2$ and $xy - z^2 = 1$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
