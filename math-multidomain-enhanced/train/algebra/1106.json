    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nFind all complex numbers $z$ that satisfy the equation $z^2 = -77 - 36i$.\nLet $z$ be a complex number and we need to find all possible values of $z$ that, when squared, result in the complex number $-77 - 36i$.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will solve this problem by assuming $z$ is in the form $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. We will substitute this into the equation $z^2 = -77 - 36i$ and equate the real and imaginary parts to form a system of equations. We will then solve this system of equations for $x$ and $y$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- For a complex number $z = x + yi$, $z^2 = (x+yi)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi$.\n- For two complex numbers to be equal, their real parts must be equal and their imaginary parts must be equal.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThen $z^2 = (x+yi)^2 = x^2 + 2xyi + (yi)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi$.\nWe are given $z^2 = -77 - 36i$.\nEquating the real and imaginary parts of $z^2$ and $-77 - 36i$, we get the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} x^2 - y^2 &= -77 \\\\ 2xy &= -36\\end{align*}\nFrom the second equation, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$:\n$y = \\frac{-36}{2x} = -\\frac{18}{x}$ (assuming $x \\neq 0$).\nSubstitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation:\n$x^2 - \\left(-\\frac{18}{x}\\right)^2 = -77$\n$x^2 - \\frac{324}{x^2} = -77$\nMultiply both sides by $x^2$ to eliminate the denominator (since $x \\neq 0$):\n$x^4 - 324 = -77x^2$\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation in $x^2$:\n$x^4 + 77x^2 - 324 = 0$\nLet $u = x^2$. Then the equation becomes:\n$u^2 + 77u - 324 = 0$\nUse the quadratic formula to solve for $u$:\n$u = \\frac{-77 \\pm \\sqrt{77^2 - 4(1)(-324)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-77 \\pm \\sqrt{5929 + 1296}}{2} = \\frac{-77 \\pm \\sqrt{7225}}{2}$\nSince $\\sqrt{7225} = 85$,\n$u = \\frac{-77 \\pm 85}{2}$\nWe have two possible values for $u$:\n$u_1 = \\frac{-77 + 85}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-77 - 85}{2} = \\frac{-162}{2} = -81$\nSince $u = x^2$ and $x$ is a real number, $x^2$ must be non-negative, so $u \\ge 0$. Therefore, $u = 4$ is the only valid solution for $u$.\n$x^2 = 4 \\implies x = \\pm 2$\n\nNow, find the corresponding values of $y$ using $y = -\\frac{18}{x}$.\nIf $x = 2$, $y = -\\frac{18}{2} = -9$.\nIf $x = -2$, $y = -\\frac{18}{-2} = 9$.\n\nSo we have two solutions for $z = x + yi$:\n$z_1 = 2 - 9i$\n$z_2 = -2 + 9i$\n\nCheck the solutions:\nFor $z_1 = 2 - 9i$:\n$z_1^2 = (2 - 9i)^2 = 4 - 36i + (9i)^2 = 4 - 36i - 81 = -77 - 36i$.\nFor $z_2 = -2 + 9i$:\n$z_2^2 = (-2 + 9i)^2 = 4 - 36i + (9i)^2 = 4 - 36i - 81 = -77 - 36i$.\nBoth solutions are correct.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe complex numbers are $2 - 9i$ and $-2 + 9i$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2-9i, -2+9i}$",
