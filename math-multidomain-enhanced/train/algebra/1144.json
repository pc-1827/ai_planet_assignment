    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\nFind the $y-$coordinate of a point $P$ that satisfies $PA + PD = PB + PC = 8,$ where $A = (-3, 0),$ $B=(-2,1),$ $C=(2,1),$ and $D=(3,0).$ The $y-$coordinate is to be expressed in the form $\\frac{-a + b \\sqrt{c}}{d},$ where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are positive integers.  Find the value of $a + b + c + d.$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nLet $P = (x, y).$\nThe condition $PA + PD = 8$ means that $P$ lies on an ellipse with foci $A$ and $D$ and major axis sum $8.$\nThe condition $PB + PC = 8$ means that $P$ lies on an ellipse with foci $B$ and $C$ and major axis sum $8.$\nWe will find the equations of these two ellipses and solve for their intersection points. We are interested in the $y-$coordinate of the intersection points.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\nFor the condition $PA + PD = 8,$ the foci are $A = (-3, 0)$ and $D = (3, 0).$ The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of $AD,$ which is $(0, 0).$ The distance between foci is $2c = AD = 3 - (-3) = 6,$ so $c = 3.$ The major axis sum is $2a = 8,$ so $a = 4.$ Then $b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 4^2 - 3^2 = 16 - 9 = 7.$ The equation of the ellipse is $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,$ which is\n\\[ \\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1. \\]\nFor the condition $PB + PC = 8,$ the foci are $B = (-2, 1)$ and $C = (2, 1).$ The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of $BC,$ which is $(0, 1).$ The distance between foci is $2c = BC = 2 - (-2) = 4,$ so $c = 2.$ The major axis sum is $2a = 8,$ so $a = 4.$ Then $b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 4^2 - 2^2 = 16 - 4 = 12.$ The equation of the ellipse is $\\frac{(x-0)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{b^2} = 1,$ which is\n\\[ \\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12} = 1. \\]\nTo find the intersection of the two ellipses, we can set the expressions for $\\frac{x^2}{16}$ equal to each other from both equations.\nFrom the first ellipse, $\\frac{x^2}{16} = 1 - \\frac{y^2}{7}.$\nFrom the second ellipse, $\\frac{x^2}{16} = 1 - \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12}.$\nSetting them equal, we get\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1 - \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12}. \\]\n\\[ \\frac{y^2}{7} = \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12}. \\]\n\\[ 12y^2 = 7(y-1)^2. \\]\n\\[ 12y^2 = 7(y^2 - 2y + 1). \\]\n\\[ 12y^2 = 7y^2 - 14y + 7. \\]\n\\[ 5y^2 + 14y - 7 = 0. \\]\nUsing the quadratic formula,\n\\[ y = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2 - 4(5)(-7)}}{2(5)} = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{196 + 140}}{10} = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{336}}{10} = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{16 \\cdot 21}}{10} = \\frac{-14 \\pm 4\\sqrt{21}}{10} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 2\\sqrt{21}}{5}. \\]\nWe are asked for the form $\\frac{-a + b \\sqrt{c}}{d}$ with positive integers $a, b, c, d.$ We take the solution with the plus sign:\n\\[ y = \\frac{-7 + 2\\sqrt{21}}{5}. \\]\nHere $a = 7,$ $b = 2,$ $c = 21,$ $d = 5.$ These are all positive integers.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nWe have $a = 7,$ $b = 2,$ $c = 21,$ $d = 5.$\nThen $a + b + c + d = 7 + 2 + 21 + 5 = 35.$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{35}$",
