    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n- Given a polynomial $p(x).$\n- When $p(x)$ is divided by $x - 1,$ the remainder is $-1.$ This means $p(1) = -1.$\n- When $p(x)$ is divided by $x - 2,$ the remainder is $3.$ This means $p(2) = 3.$\n- When $p(x)$ is divided by $x + 3,$ the remainder is $4.$ This means $p(-3) = 4.$\n- Let $r(x)$ be the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $d(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3).$\n- We need to find the value of $r(6).$\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $p(x)$: Polynomial\n- $x - 1, x - 2, x + 3$: Divisors\n- $-1, 3, 4$: Corresponding remainders\n- $d(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)$: Divisor\n- $r(x)$: Remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $d(x).$ Degree of $r(x)$ is at most 2.\n- We need to calculate $r(6).$\n\n## Solution Strategy\n1. Use the Remainder Theorem to establish the values of $p(1), p(2),$ and $p(-3).$\n2. Since the divisor $d(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)$ is of degree 3, the remainder $r(x)$ is of degree at most 2. Let $r(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$\n3. Use the division algorithm $p(x) = q(x)d(x) + r(x)$ and the values of $p(1), p(2), p(-3)$ to set up a system of linear equations for $a, b, c.$\n4. Solve the system of linear equations to find $a, b, c.$\n5. Calculate $r(6) = a(6)^2 + b(6) + c.$\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Apply the Remainder Theorem:**\n   - $p(1) = -1$\n   - $p(2) = 3$\n   - $p(-3) = 4$\n\n2. **Express the remainder $r(x)$:**\n   Since the divisor is of degree 3, let the remainder be a quadratic polynomial:\n   $r(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$\n\n3. **Use the division algorithm and the values of $p(1), p(2), p(-3)$:**\n   We have $p(x) = q(x)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3) + r(x).$\n   Substituting $x = 1, 2, -3,$ we get:\n   $p(1) = r(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c = -1$  (Equation 1)\n   $p(2) = r(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 4a + 2b + c = 3$  (Equation 2)\n   $p(-3) = r(-3) = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 9a - 3b + c = 4$  (Equation 3)\n\n4. **Solve the system of linear equations:**\n   Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n   $(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 3 - (-1) \\implies 3a + b = 4$  (Equation 4)\n   Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:\n   $(9a - 3b + c) - (a + b + c) = 4 - (-1) \\implies 8a - 4b = 5$  (Equation 5)\n   From Equation 4, $b = 4 - 3a.$ Substitute this into Equation 5:\n   $8a - 4(4 - 3a) = 5 \\implies 8a - 16 + 12a = 5 \\implies 20a = 21 \\implies a = \\frac{21}{20}.$\n   Substitute $a = \\frac{21}{20}$ into Equation 4:\n   $b = 4 - 3a = 4 - 3\\left(\\frac{21}{20}\\right) = 4 - \\frac{63}{20} = \\frac{80 - 63}{20} = \\frac{17}{20}.$\n   Substitute $a = \\frac{21}{20}$ and $b = \\frac{17}{20}$ into Equation 1:\n   $c = -1 - a - b = -1 - \\frac{21}{20} - \\frac{17}{20} = -1 - \\frac{38}{20} = -1 - \\frac{19}{10} = \\frac{-10 - 19}{10} = -\\frac{29}{10} = -\\frac{58}{20}.$\n\n   So, $r(x) = \\frac{21}{20}x^2 + \\frac{17}{20}x - \\frac{58}{20} = \\frac{1}{20}(21x^2 + 17x - 58).$\n\n5. **Calculate $r(6)$:**\n   $r(6) = \\frac{1}{20}(21(6)^2 + 17(6) - 58) = \\frac{1}{20}(21(36) + 102 - 58) = \\frac{1}{20}(756 + 102 - 58) = \\frac{1}{20}(858 - 58) = \\frac{800}{20} = 40.$\n\n## Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{40}$",
