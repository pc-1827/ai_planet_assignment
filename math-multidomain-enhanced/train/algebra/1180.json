Problem Statement**\n\nGiven the equation $f^{-1}(g(x)) = x^3 - 1$, where $f^{-1}$ is the inverse function of $f$ and $g$ is a function that has an inverse $g^{-1}$, we need to find the value of $g^{-1}(f(7))$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Equation: $f^{-1}(g(x)) = x^3 - 1$\n- $g$ has an inverse $g^{-1}$\n- Target value: $g^{-1}(f(7))$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nOur goal is to isolate $g^{-1}(f(7))$ from the given equation. We will use the properties of inverse functions to manipulate the equation and solve for the desired expression.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1. Let $y = g(x)$. Then $x = g^{-1}(y)$.\n2. Substitute $y = g(x)$ into the given equation to get $f^{-1}(y) = x^3 - 1$.\n3. Substitute $x = g^{-1}(y)$ into the equation to express $f^{-1}(y)$ in terms of $g^{-1}(y)$.\n4. We get $f^{-1}(y) = (g^{-1}(y))^3 - 1$.\n5. We want to find $g^{-1}(f(7))$. Let $y = f(7)$.\n6. Substitute $y = f(7)$ into the equation from step 4.\n7. Solve for $g^{-1}(f(7))$.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- Definition of inverse function: $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ and $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$.\n- If $y = g(x)$, then $x = g^{-1}(y)$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Start with the given equation:\n$f^{-1}(g(x)) = x^3 - 1$\n\nStep 2: Let $y = g(x)$. Since $g$ has an inverse, we can write $x = g^{-1}(y)$.\n\nStep 3: Substitute $y = g(x)$ into the given equation:\n$f^{-1}(y) = x^3 - 1$\n\nStep 4: Substitute $x = g^{-1}(y)$ into the equation from Step 3:\n$f^{-1}(y) = (g^{-1}(y))^3 - 1$\n\nStep 5: We want to find $g^{-1}(f(7))$. Let $y = f(7)$.\n\nStep 6: Substitute $y = f(7)$ into the equation from Step 4:\n$f^{-1}(f(7)) = (g^{-1}(f(7)))^3 - 1$\n\nStep 7: Simplify $f^{-1}(f(7))$ using the property of inverse functions $f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$:\n$7 = (g^{-1}(f(7)))^3 - 1$\n\nStep 8: Solve for $g^{-1}(f(7))$:\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n$7 + 1 = (g^{-1}(f(7)))^3$\n$8 = (g^{-1}(f(7)))^3$\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n$\\sqrt[3]{8} = \\sqrt[3]{(g^{-1}(f(7)))^3}$\n$2 = g^{-1}(f(7))$\n\nThus, $g^{-1}(f(7)) = 2$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$\n\nVerification:\nIf $g^{-1}(f(7)) = 2$, then $g(2) = f(7)$.\nFrom $f^{-1}(g(x)) = x^3 - 1$, let $x=2$.\n$f^{-1}(g(2)) = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nApply $f$ to both sides:\n$f(f^{-1}(g(2))) = f(7)$\n$g(2) = f(7)$\nThis is consistent with our initial assumption $g^{-1}(f(7)) = 2$. The answer satisfies all conditions.",
