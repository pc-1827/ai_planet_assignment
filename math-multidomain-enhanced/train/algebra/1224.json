    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\nFind all values of $z$ that satisfy the equation $z^4 - 4z^2 + 3 = 0$.\nThe variable we need to solve for is $z$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nWe can solve this equation by using a substitution to transform it into a quadratic equation. Let $x = z^2$.  This substitution will convert the given quartic equation into a quadratic equation in terms of $x$. We can then solve for $x$ using factoring or the quadratic formula. Once we have the values of $x$, we can find the values of $z$ by solving $z^2 = x$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Substitution method for solving equations.\n- Factoring quadratic equations.\n- Solving equations of the form $z^2 = a$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\nLet $x = z^2$. Substituting this into the given equation $z^4 - 4z^2 + 3 = 0$, we get:\n$(z^2)^2 - 4(z^2) + 3 = 0$\n$x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation in $x$. We can solve this by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to 3 and add up to -4. These numbers are -1 and -3.\nSo, we can factor the quadratic equation as:\n$(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0$\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either $x - 1 = 0$ or $x - 3 = 0$.\nThus, we have two possible values for $x$:\n$x = 1$ or $x = 3$\n\nNow we need to find the values of $z$ for each value of $x$ using the substitution $x = z^2$.\n\nCase 1: $x = 1$\n$z^2 = 1$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$z = \\pm \\sqrt{1} = \\pm 1$\nSo, $z = 1$ or $z = -1$.\n\nCase 2: $x = 3$\n$z^2 = 3$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$z = \\pm \\sqrt{3}$\nSo, $z = \\sqrt{3}$ or $z = -\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for $z$ are $1, -1, \\sqrt{3}, -\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nThe solutions to the equation $z^4 - 4z^2 + 3 = 0$ are $z = 1, -1, \\sqrt{3}, -\\sqrt{3}$.\nTo verify these solutions, we substitute each value back into the original equation:\n\nFor $z=1$: $(1)^4 - 4(1)^2 + 3 = 1 - 4 + 3 = 0$\nFor $z=-1$: $(-1)^4 - 4(-1)^2 + 3 = 1 - 4(1) + 3 = 1 - 4 + 3 = 0$\nFor $z=\\sqrt{3}$: $(\\sqrt{3})^4 - 4(\\sqrt{3})^2 + 3 = (3^2) - 4(3) + 3 = 9 - 12 + 3 = 0$\nFor $z=-\\sqrt{3}$: $(-\\sqrt{3})^4 - 4(-\\sqrt{3})^2 + 3 = (3^2) - 4(3) + 3 = 9 - 12 + 3 = 0$\n\nAll four solutions satisfy the original equation.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1, -1, \\sqrt{3}, -\\sqrt{3}}",
