    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nLet the increasing sequence of four positive integers be denoted by $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$. We are given the following conditions:\n- The sequence is increasing: $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4$.\n- The first three terms form an arithmetic progression: $a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2$.\n- The last three terms form a geometric progression: $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\frac{a_4}{a_3}$.\n- The first and fourth terms differ by $30$: $a_4 - a_1 = 30$.\nWe need to find the sum of the four terms: $S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.\n\n### Solution Strategy\n1. Express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and a common difference $d$ using the arithmetic progression condition.\n2. Express $a_4$ in terms of $a_2$ and $a_3$ using the geometric progression condition.\n3. Use the condition $a_4 - a_1 = 30$ to form an equation in terms of $a_1$ and $d$.\n4. Solve for $a_1$ and $d$. Since the terms are positive integers, we need to find integer solutions.\n5. Calculate the sum of the four terms.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Arithmetic progression: $a_2 = a_1 + d$, $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$.\n- Geometric progression: $a_3^2 = a_2 a_4$, so $a_4 = \\frac{a_3^2}{a_2}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\nLet the first term be $a_1 = a$ and the common difference of the arithmetic progression be $d$. Since the sequence is increasing and consists of positive integers, $a$ and $d$ must be positive integers.\nThen the first three terms are:\n$a_1 = a$\n$a_2 = a + d$\n$a_3 = a + 2d$\n\nSince the last three terms $a_2, a_3, a_4$ form a geometric progression, we have:\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\frac{a_4}{a_3}$\n$a_4 = \\frac{a_3^2}{a_2} = \\frac{(a + 2d)^2}{a + d}$\n\nWe are given that the first and fourth terms differ by $30$:\n$a_4 - a_1 = 30$\n$\\frac{(a + 2d)^2}{a + d} - a = 30$\n$\\frac{(a + 2d)^2 - a(a + d)}{a + d} = 30$\n$\\frac{a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2 - a^2 - ad}{a + d} = 30$\n$\\frac{3ad + 4d^2}{a + d} = 30$\n$3ad + 4d^2 = 30(a + d)$\n$3ad + 4d^2 = 30a + 30d$\n$4d^2 + 3ad - 30d - 30a = 0$\nRearrange to solve for $a$:\n$a(3d - 30) = 30d - 4d^2$\n$a = \\frac{30d - 4d^2}{3d - 30} = \\frac{d(30 - 4d)}{3(d - 10)} = \\frac{2d(15 - 2d)}{3(d - 10)} = \\frac{2d(2d - 15)}{3(10 - d)}$\n\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, we need $a > 0$. For $a > 0$, we need $\\frac{2d(2d - 15)}{3(10 - d)} > 0$.\nSince $d > 0$, we need $\\frac{2d - 15}{10 - d} > 0$.\nCase 1: $2d - 15 > 0$ and $10 - d > 0$.\n$d > \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5$ and $d < 10$. So $7.5 < d < 10$. Integer values for $d$ are $8, 9$.\nCase 2: $2d - 15 < 0$ and $10 - d < 0$.\n$d < \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5$ and $d > 10$. No solution.\n\nCheck $d = 9$:\n$a = \\frac{2 \\times 9 (2 \\times 9 - 15)}{3(10 - 9)} = \\frac{18 (18 - 15)}{3 \\times 1} = \\frac{18 \\times 3}{3} = 18$.\n$a_1 = 18$, $a_2 = 18 + 9 = 27$, $a_3 = 18 + 2 \\times 9 = 36$, $a_4 = \\frac{36^2}{27} = \\frac{1296}{27} = 48$.\nSequence: $18, 27, 36, 48$.\nIncreasing: $18 < 27 < 36 < 48$. Yes.\nArithmetic progression: $27 - 18 = 9$, $36 - 27 = 9$. Yes.\nGeometric progression: $\\frac{36}{27} = \\frac{4}{3}$, $\\frac{48}{36} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Yes.\n$a_4 - a_1 = 48 - 18 = 30$. Yes.\n\nCheck $d = 8$:\n$a = \\frac{2 \\times 8 (2 \\times 8 - 15)}{3(10 - 8)} = \\frac{16 (16 - 15)}{3 \\times 2} = \\frac{16 \\times 1}{6} = \\frac{8}{3}$. Not an integer.\n\nSo $d = 9$ and $a = 18$ is the only integer solution.\nThe four terms are $18, 27, 36, 48$.\nSum of the terms: $18 + 27 + 36 + 48 = 129$.\n\n### Final Answer\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   Find the sum of four terms in an increasing sequence of positive integers where the first three terms form an arithmetic progression, the last three terms form a geometric progression, and the difference between the first and fourth terms is $30$. Let the four terms be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$. We are given:\n   - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4$ and $a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n   - $a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2$ (Arithmetic Progression)\n   - $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\frac{a_4}{a_3}$ (Geometric Progression)\n   - $a_4 - a_1 = 30$\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   Let $a_1 = a$ and the common difference of the arithmetic progression be $d$. Then $a_2 = a+d$, $a_3 = a+2d$. From geometric progression, $a_4 = \\frac{a_3^2}{a_2} = \\frac{(a+2d)^2}{a+d}$. Using $a_4 - a_1 = 30$, we get an equation in $a$ and $d$. Solve for integer solutions of $a$ and $d$ and calculate the sum $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + \\frac{(a+2d)^2}{a+d}$.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   Let $a_1 = a$, $a_2 = a+d$, $a_3 = a+2d$, $a_4 = \\frac{(a+2d)^2}{a+d}$.\n   Given $a_4 - a_1 = 30$, we have $\\frac{(a+2d)^2}{a+d} - a = 30$.\n   $\\frac{3ad + 4d^2}{a+d} = 30$.\n   $3ad + 4d^2 = 30a + 30d$.\n   $a = \\frac{4d^2 - 30d}{30 - 3d} = \\frac{2d(2d - 15)}{3(10 - d)}$.\n   For $a > 0$, we need $\\frac{2d - 15}{10 - d} > 0$. This implies $7.5 < d < 10$.\n   Possible integer values for $d$ are $8, 9$.\n   For $d = 9$, $a = \\frac{2 \\times 9 (2 \\times 9 - 15)}{3(10 - 9)} = \\frac{18 \\times 3}{3} = 18$.\n   $a_1 = 18, a_2 = 27, a_3 = 36, a_4 = \\frac{36^2}{27} = 48$.\n   Sequence: $18, 27, 36, 48$.\n   Sum $= 18 + 27 + 36 + 48 = 129$.\n   For $d = 8$, $a = \\frac{2 \\times 8 (2 \\times 8 - 15)}{3(10 - 8)} = \\frac{16 \\times 1}{6} = \\frac{8}{3}$, not an integer.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The sum of the four terms is $\\boxed{129}$",
