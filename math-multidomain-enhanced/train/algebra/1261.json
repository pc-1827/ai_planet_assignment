    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n- Find the value of $m$ such that the parabola $y = x^2+2$ and the hyperbola $y^2 - mx^2 = 1$ are tangent.\n- Key variables: $m$, $x$, $y$.\n- Constraints: Tangency condition between the parabola and hyperbola.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n- For two curves to be tangent, they must intersect at a point and have the same slope at that point.\n- Let $(x_0, y_0)$ be the point of tangency.\n- Set the y-values of both curves equal at $(x_0, y_0)$:\n  $y_0 = x_0^2+2$ and $y_0^2 - mx_0^2 = 1$.\n- Set the derivatives of both curves equal at $(x_0, y_0)$.\n  Find $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ for both curves.\n  For parabola: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$. Slope $m_1 = 2x_0$.\n  For hyperbola: Differentiate $y^2 - mx^2 = 1$ implicitly to find $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{mx}{y}$. Slope $m_2 = \\frac{mx_0}{y_0}$.\n  Set $m_1 = m_2$: $2x_0 = \\frac{mx_0}{y_0}$.\n- Solve the system of equations to find $m$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n- **Step 1: Equations from intersection and equal slopes**\n  At the point of tangency $(x_0, y_0)$, we have:\n  1) $y_0 = x_0^2+2$ (Point on parabola)\n  2) $y_0^2 - mx_0^2 = 1$ (Point on hyperbola)\n  3) $2x_0 = \\frac{mx_0}{y_0}$ (Equal slopes)\n\n- **Step 2: Analyze the slope equation**\n  From equation (3), $2x_0 = \\frac{mx_0}{y_0}$.\n  Rearrange to $2x_0 y_0 = mx_0$, or $x_0(2y_0 - m) = 0$.\n  This gives two possibilities: $x_0 = 0$ or $2y_0 - m = 0$.\n\n  - **Case 1: $x_0 = 0$**\n    Substitute $x_0 = 0$ into equation (1): $y_0 = 0^2 + 2 = 2$.\n    Substitute $x_0 = 0$ and $y_0 = 2$ into equation (2): $2^2 - m(0)^2 = 1 \\implies 4 = 1$.\n    This is a contradiction, so $x_0 \\neq 0$.\n\n  - **Case 2: $2y_0 - m = 0$**\n    This implies $m = 2y_0$.\n\n- **Step 3: Substitute $m = 2y_0$ into the hyperbola equation**\n  Substitute $m = 2y_0$ into equation (2): $y_0^2 - (2y_0)x_0^2 = 1$.\n\n- **Step 4: Use the parabola equation to eliminate $x_0^2$**\n  From equation (1), $x_0^2 = y_0 - 2$.\n  Substitute $x_0^2 = y_0 - 2$ into $y_0^2 - (2y_0)x_0^2 = 1$:\n  $y_0^2 - 2y_0(y_0 - 2) = 1$\n  $y_0^2 - 2y_0^2 + 4y_0 = 1$\n  $-y_0^2 + 4y_0 - 1 = 0$\n  $y_0^2 - 4y_0 + 1 = 0$\n\n- **Step 5: Solve for $y_0$ using the quadratic formula**\n  $y_0 = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n  Since $y = x^2+2$, we must have $y \\ge 2$. Therefore, $y_0 = 2 + \\sqrt{3}$ is the valid solution (as $2 + \\sqrt{3} > 2$ and $2 - \\sqrt{3} < 2$).\n\n- **Step 6: Calculate $m$ using $m = 2y_0$**\n  $m = 2y_0 = 2(2 + \\sqrt{3}) = 4 + 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{4+2\\sqrt{3}}$",
