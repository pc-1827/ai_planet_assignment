    "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\n1. **Problem Statement:**\n   Find all possible values of the expression $x^2 + 5x + 6$, where $x$ is a real number satisfying the inequality $x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0$.\n\n2. **Key Variables and Constraints:**\n   - Variable: $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n   - Constraint: $x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0$\n   - Expression to evaluate the range: $x^2 + 5x + 6$\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\n1. **Solve the inequality:** First, we need to find the range of values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0$. We will factor the quadratic expression and determine the interval for $x$.\n2. **Analyze the expression:** Next, we need to analyze the expression $x^2 + 5x + 6$. We can determine if this expression is increasing or decreasing in the interval found in step 1. We can use calculus (derivative) or properties of quadratic functions to determine this.\n3. **Find the range:** Finally, we will use the interval for $x$ and the behavior of the expression to find the range of possible values of $x^2 + 5x + 6$.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Solve the inequality $x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0$.**\n   - Factor the quadratic expression: $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3)$.\n   - The inequality becomes $(x-2)(x-3) < 0$.\n   - We consider the signs of the factors $(x-2)$ and $(x-3)$.\n     - Case 1: $x-2 > 0$ and $x-3 < 0$. This implies $x > 2$ and $x < 3$. Thus, $2 < x < 3$.\n     - Case 2: $x-2 < 0$ and $x-3 > 0$. This implies $x < 2$ and $x > 3$. This is impossible.\n   - Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $2 < x < 3$.\n\n2. **Analyze the expression $y = x^2 + 5x + 6$.**\n   - We want to find the range of $y = x^2 + 5x + 6$ for $2 < x < 3$.\n   - Consider the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$: $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 5$.\n   - For $x$ in the interval $(2, 3)$, we have $2x > 4$, so $2x + 5 > 4 + 5 = 9 > 0$.\n   - Since $\\frac{dy}{dx} > 0$ for $2 < x < 3$, the function $y = x^2 + 5x + 6$ is strictly increasing in the interval $(2, 3)$.\n\n3. **Find the range of $y = x^2 + 5x + 6$ for $2 < x < 3$.**\n   - Since $y$ is strictly increasing on $(2, 3)$, the minimum value of $y$ is approached as $x$ approaches 2 from the right, and the maximum value of $y$ is approached as $x$ approaches 3 from the left.\n   - As $x \\to 2^+$, $y = x^2 + 5x + 6 \\to 2^2 + 5(2) + 6 = 4 + 10 + 6 = 20$.\n   - As $x \\to 3^-$, $y = x^2 + 5x + 6 \\to 3^2 + 5(3) + 6 = 9 + 15 + 6 = 30$.\n   - Since $y$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $(2, 3)$, the range of $y$ is the open interval $(20, 30)$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   The possible values of $x^2 + 5x + 6$ are in the interval $(20, 30).$\n   Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{(20, 30)}$",
