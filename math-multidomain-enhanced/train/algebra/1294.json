    "solution": "### Problem:\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   Find the positive value of $t$ that satisfies the equation $ab = t-2i$, where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers such that their magnitudes are $|a|=2$ and $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$.\n   - Key variables: $t$, $a$, $b$\n   - Constraints: $ab = t-2i$, $|a|=2$, $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$, $t>0$\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   We will use the property of magnitudes of complex numbers, which states that for any two complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$, $|z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2|$.\n   We will take the magnitude of both sides of the equation $ab = t-2i$.\n   Using the given magnitudes of $a$ and $b$, we will solve for $t$.\n   Relevant formulas/theorems:\n   - Magnitude of product of complex numbers: $|z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2|$\n   - Magnitude of a complex number $z = x+yi$: $|z| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   Given the equation $ab = t-2i$.\n   Take the magnitude of both sides of the equation:\n   $|ab| = |t-2i|$\n\n   Using the property of magnitudes of complex numbers, $|ab| = |a||b|$.\n   So, $|a||b| = |t-2i|$\n\n   Substitute the given magnitudes $|a|=2$ and $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$ into the equation:\n   $(2)(\\sqrt{26}) = |t-2i|$\n   $2\\sqrt{26} = |t-2i|$\n\n   The complex number on the right side is $t-2i$, where $t$ is a real number.\n   The magnitude of $t-2i$ is $|t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{t^2+4}$.\n   So, we have the equation:\n   $2\\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{t^2+4}$\n\n   To solve for $t$, square both sides of the equation:\n   $(2\\sqrt{26})^2 = (\\sqrt{t^2+4})^2$\n   $4 \\times 26 = t^2+4$\n   $104 = t^2+4$\n\n   Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate $t^2$:\n   $t^2 = 104 - 4$\n   $t^2 = 100$\n\n   Take the square root of both sides to find $t$:\n   $t = \\pm \\sqrt{100}$\n   $t = \\pm 10$\n\n   We are asked for the positive value of $t$.\n   Therefore, $t = 10$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The positive value of $t$ is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\n   Verification:\n   If $t=10$, then $ab = 10 - 2i$.\n   $|ab| = |10-2i| = \\sqrt{10^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{100+4} = \\sqrt{104} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 26} = 2\\sqrt{26}$.\n   Also, $|a||b| = 2 \\times \\sqrt{26} = 2\\sqrt{26}$.\n   Since $|ab| = |a||b|$, the value $t=10$ is consistent with the given magnitudes of $a$ and $b$. And $t=10$ is a positive value.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{10}$",
