Problem Statement\nFind a polynomial $p(x)$ with real coefficients that satisfies the functional equation\n\\[p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12\\]\nfor all real numbers $x.$\nThe key variables are the coefficients of the polynomial $p(x).$ The constraint is that the equation must hold for all real numbers $x.$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will first determine the degree of the polynomial $p(x)$ by comparing the degrees of both sides of the equation. Then, we will assume a general polynomial of that degree and substitute it into the equation. By comparing the coefficients of the resulting polynomials on both sides, we will determine the coefficients of $p(x).$ Finally, we will verify if the obtained polynomial satisfies the given equation.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Determine the degree of $p(x).$**\nLet the degree of $p(x)$ be $n.$ Then the degree of $p(x^3)$ and $p(x^3 - 2)$ is $3n.$\nThe degree of $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ will be at most $3n-1$ if the leading terms cancel out, or $3n$ if they do not.\nThe degree of $[p(x)]^2$ is $2n.$\nFor the equation to hold, the degrees of both sides must be equal.\nLet $p(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots$ with $a_n \\ne 0.$\nThen $p(x^3) = a_n (x^3)^n + \\dots = a_n x^{3n} + \\dots$\n$p(x^3 - 2) = a_n (x^3 - 2)^n + \\dots = a_n (x^{3n} - 2n x^{3n-3} + \\dots) + \\dots = a_n x^{3n} - 2na_n x^{3n-3} + \\dots$\n$p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = (a_n x^{3n} + \\dots) - (a_n x^{3n} - 2na_n x^{3n-3} + \\dots) = 2na_n x^{3n-3} + \\dots$\nThe degree of the LHS is $3n-3.$\nThe degree of the RHS is $2n.$\nEquating the degrees, we have $3n-3 = 2n,$ which gives $n = 3.$\nSo, we assume $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n\n**Step 2: Assume $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.$**\nSubstitute this into the given equation:\n$p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12$\n\nFirst, compute $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2).$\n$p(x^3) = a(x^3)^3 + b(x^3)^2 + c(x^3) + d = ax^9 + bx^6 + cx^3 + d.$\n$p(x^3 - 2) = a(x^3 - 2)^3 + b(x^3 - 2)^2 + c(x^3 - 2) + d$\n$p(x^3 - 2) = a(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x^3 - 8) + b(x^6 - 4x^3 + 4) + c(x^3 - 2) + d$\n$p(x^3 - 2) = ax^9 - 6ax^6 + 12ax^3 - 8a + bx^6 - 4bx^3 + 4b + cx^3 - 2c + d$\n$p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = (ax^9 + bx^6 + cx^3 + d) - (ax^9 - 6ax^6 + 12ax^3 - 8a + bx^6 - 4bx^3 + 4b + cx^3 - 2c + d)$\n$p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = 6ax^6 + (-12a - 4b + b)x^6 + (c - 12a - 4b + c - c)x^3 + (d - (-8a + 4b - 2c + d))$\n$p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = 6ax^6 + (b - b + 6a)x^6 + (c - 12a - 4b - c)x^3 + (d - (-8a + 4b - 2c + d))$\n$p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = 6ax^6 + (4b - 12a)x^3 + (8a - 4b + 2c).$\n\nNext, compute $[p(x)]^2 + 12.$\n$[p(x)]^2 + 12 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 + 12$\n$[p(x)]^2 + 12 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) + 12$\n$[p(x)]^2 + 12 = a^2 x^6 + abx^5 + acx^4 + adx^3 + abx^5 + b^2 x^4 + bcx^3 + bdx^2 + acx^4 + bcx^3 + c^2 x^2 + cdx + adx^3 + bdx^2 + cdx + d^2 + 12$\n$[p(x)]^2 + 12 = a^2 x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b^2) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c^2) x^2 + 2cdx + (d^2 + 12).$\n\nEquating the coefficients of $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ and $[p(x)]^2 + 12:$\n$x^6$ coefficients: $6a = a^2 \\implies a^2 - 6a = 0 \\implies a(a-6) = 0.$ Since degree is 3, $a \\ne 0,$ so $a = 6.$\n$x^5$ coefficients: $0 = 2ab.$ Since $a = 6 \\ne 0,$ $b = 0.$\n$x^4$ coefficients: $0 = 2ac + b^2.$ Since $b = 0,$ $2ac = 0.$ Since $a = 6 \\ne 0,$ $c = 0.$\n$x^3$ coefficients: $4b - 12a = 2ad + 2bc.$ Since $b = 0, c = 0, a = 6,$ $4(0) - 12(6) = 2(6)d + 2(0)(0).$ $-72 = 12d \\implies d = -6.$\n$x^2$ coefficients: $0 = 2bd + c^2.$ Since $b = 0, c = 0,$ $0 = 2(0)d + 0^2 = 0.$ Consistent.\n$x^1$ coefficients: $0 = 2cd.$ Since $c = 0,$ $0 = 2(0)d = 0.$ Consistent.\n$x^0$ coefficients: $8a - 4b + 2c = d^2 + 12.$ Since $a = 6, b = 0, c = 0, d = -6,$ $8(6) - 4(0) + 2(0) = (-6)^2 + 12.$ $48 = 36 + 12 = 48.$ Consistent.\n\nSo, $a = 6, b = 0, c = 0, d = -6.$\nTherefore, $p(x) = 6x^3 - 6.$\n\n**Step 3: Verify the solution.**\n$p(x) = 6x^3 - 6.$\n$p(x^3) = 6(x^3)^3 - 6 = 6x^9 - 6.$\n$p(x^3 - 2) = 6(x^3 - 2)^3 - 6 = 6(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x^3 - 8) - 6 = 6x^9 - 36x^6 + 72x^3 - 48 - 6 = 6x^9 - 36x^6 + 72x^3 - 54.$\n$p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = (6x^9 - 6) - (6x^9 - 36x^6 + 72x^3 - 54) = 36x^6 - 72x^3 + 48.$\n$[p(x)]^2 + 12 = [6x^3 - 6]^2 + 12 = (6x^3 - 6)(6x^3 - 6) + 12 = 36x^6 - 36x^3 - 36x^3 + 36 + 12 = 36x^6 - 72x^3 + 48.$\nSo, $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12$ is satisfied.\n\n### 4.
