    "solution": "## Solution:\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\nGiven nonzero polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ such that $f(g(x)) = f(x) g(x).$\nWe are also given that $g(2) = 37.$\nThe objective is to find the polynomial $g(x).$\n\nKey Variables and Constraints:\n- $f(x), g(x)$ are nonzero polynomials\n- $f(g(x)) = f(x) g(x)$\n- $g(2) = 37$\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\nWe will first analyze the degrees of the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x).$ Let $\\deg(f) = m$ and $\\deg(g) = n.$\nFrom the given equation $f(g(x)) = f(x) g(x),$ we will compare the degrees of both sides.\nThen we will try to find the form of $g(x)$ that satisfies the given condition, considering the degree and the condition $g(2) = 37.$\nWe will assume a form for $f(x)$ and deduce the form of $g(x).$\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\nFirst, let's consider the degrees of the polynomials.\nLet $\\deg(f(x)) = m$ and $\\deg(g(x)) = n.$\nThen $\\deg(f(g(x))) = m \\cdot n.$\nAnd $\\deg(f(x) g(x)) = \\deg(f(x)) + \\deg(g(x)) = m + n.$\nEquating the degrees, we have $mn = m + n.$\nRearranging the equation, we get $mn - m - n = 0.$\nAdd 1 to both sides: $mn - m - n + 1 = 1.$\nFactor the left side: $(m-1)(n-1) = 1.$\nSince $m$ and $n$ are non-negative integers (degrees of polynomials), we have two possible cases for integer solutions:\nCase 1: $m-1 = 1$ and $n-1 = 1.$ This gives $m = 2$ and $n = 2.$\nCase 2: $m-1 = -1$ and $n-1 = -1.$ This gives $m = 0$ and $n = 0.$\nIf $m = 0$ and $n = 0,$ then $f(x) = c_1$ and $g(x) = c_2$ are nonzero constants.\n$f(g(x)) = c_1.$ $f(x) g(x) = c_1 c_2.$\nSo $c_1 = c_1 c_2.$ Since $c_1 \\ne 0,$ we have $c_2 = 1.$ Thus $g(x) = 1.$\nHowever, $g(2) = 37,$ so $g(x)$ cannot be a constant polynomial $1.$\nTherefore, we must have $m = 2$ and $n = 2.$\nSo $\\deg(f(x)) = 2$ and $\\deg(g(x)) = 2.$\n\nLet's assume $f(x) = x^2 + qx$ for some constant $q.$\nThen $f(g(x)) = (g(x))^2 + q g(x) = g(x) (g(x) + q).$\nWe want $f(g(x)) = f(x) g(x) = (x^2 + qx) g(x) = x(x+q) g(x).$\nComparing $g(x) (g(x) + q) = x(x+q) g(x).$\nSince $g(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial, we can divide by $g(x)$ (for values of $x$ where $g(x) \\ne 0$).\n$g(x) + q = x(x+q) = x^2 + qx.$\n$g(x) = x^2 + qx - q.$\nWe are given $g(2) = 37.$\n$g(2) = 2^2 + q(2) - q = 4 + 2q - q = 4 + q = 37.$\n$q = 37 - 4 = 33.$\nSo $g(x) = x^2 + 33x - 33.$\nLet's verify this with $f(x) = x^2 + 33x.$\n$f(g(x)) = (g(x))^2 + 33 g(x) = g(x) (g(x) + 33) = (x^2 + 33x - 33) (x^2 + 33x - 33 + 33) = (x^2 + 33x - 33) (x^2 + 33x).$\n$f(x) g(x) = (x^2 + 33x) (x^2 + 33x - 33).$\nSo $f(g(x)) = f(x) g(x)$ holds for $f(x) = x^2 + 33x$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 33x - 33.$\nAlso $g(2) = 2^2 + 33(2) - 33 = 4 + 66 - 33 = 37.$\n\n4. **Final Answer**\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{g(x) = x^2 + 33x - 33}$",
