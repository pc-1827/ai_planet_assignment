Problem Statement\nFind the equation of the directrix of the parabola given by the equation $x = -\\frac{1}{6} y^2.$\n\n- **Key Variable**: The equation of the parabola is given in the form $x = -\\frac{1}{6} y^2.$\n- **Constraint**: We need to find the equation of the directrix for this parabola.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nThe given equation is of a parabola that opens horizontally. We will rewrite the equation in the standard form of a horizontal parabola, which is $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex and $p$ is the distance from the vertex to the focus and from the vertex to the directrix. Once we have the value of $p$ and the vertex $(h,k)$, we can find the equation of the directrix, which for a horizontal parabola is given by $x = h - p$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n**Step 1: Rewrite the given equation in the standard form $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$.**\nGiven equation: $x = -\\frac{1}{6} y^2.$\nMultiply both sides by $-6$ to isolate $y^2$:\n$-6x = y^2$\nRewrite as: $y^2 = -6x$\nWe can write this as $(y-0)^2 = -6(x-0)$.\nComparing this with the standard form $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, we can identify the values for $h$, $k$, and $4p$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the vertex $(h,k)$ and the value of $4p$.**\nFrom $(y-0)^2 = -6(x-0)$, we have:\n$h = 0$\n$k = 0$\n$4p = -6$\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is $(h,k) = (0,0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the value of $p$.**\nFrom $4p = -6$, divide both sides by 4 to solve for $p$:\n$p = \\frac{-6}{4} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the equation of the directrix.**\nFor a horizontal parabola with vertex $(h,k)$ and parameter $p$, the equation of the directrix is given by $x = h - p$.\nSubstitute the values of $h = 0$ and $p = -\\frac{3}{2}$ into the equation of the directrix:\n$x = 0 - (-\\frac{3}{2})$\n$x = 0 + \\frac{3}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\n**Step 5: Verify the answer.**\nFor a parabola $y^2 = 4px$ with vertex at the origin, the directrix is $x = -p$. In our case, we have $y^2 = -6x$, so $4p = -6$, which means $p = -\\frac{3}{2}$. The directrix should be $x = -p = -(-\\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{3}{2}$. This matches our result.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe equation of the directrix of the parabola $x = -\\frac{1}{6} y^2$ is $\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}$.",
