Problem Statement**\n\nExpress the sum of the following series as a simple fraction in lowest terms:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{1\\times2} + \\frac{1}{2\\times3} + \\frac{1}{3\\times4} + \\frac{1}{4\\times5} + \\frac{1}{5\\times6}$$\n\nThe key variables are the terms of the series, each of the form $\\frac{1}{n \\times (n+1)}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. The constraint is to express the sum as a simple fraction in lowest terms.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the method of partial fraction decomposition to simplify each term in the sum. We know that a fraction of the form $\\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$ can be decomposed into the difference of two simpler fractions. Specifically, we will use the identity:\n$$\\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+1}$$\nAfter decomposing each term, we will observe that the sum becomes a telescoping series, where intermediate terms cancel out, leaving a simplified expression. Finally, we will compute the sum and express it as a fraction in lowest terms.\n\n**Relevant Formula:**\nPartial Fraction Decomposition: $\\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+1}$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Decompose each term using partial fractions.**\nFor each term in the series, we apply the partial fraction decomposition formula:\n\nTerm 1: $\\frac{1}{1\\times2} = \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{2}$\nTerm 2: $\\frac{1}{2\\times3} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}$\nTerm 3: $\\frac{1}{3\\times4} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4}$\nTerm 4: $\\frac{1}{4\\times5} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{5}$\nTerm 5: $\\frac{1}{5\\times6} = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the decomposed terms back into the sum.**\n$$S = \\left(\\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{6}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 3: Observe the telescoping nature of the sum and cancel out intermediate terms.**\nWe can see that the negative part of each term cancels out with the positive part of the subsequent term:\n- $-\\frac{1}{2}$ cancels with $+\\frac{1}{2}$\n- $-\\frac{1}{3}$ cancels with $+\\frac{1}{3}$\n- $-\\frac{1}{4}$ cancels with $+\\frac{1}{4}$\n- $-\\frac{1}{5}$ cancels with $+\\frac{1}{5}$\n\nAfter cancellation, we are left with the first positive part and the last negative part:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final sum.**\n$$S = 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6-1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\n**Step 5: Verify that the fraction is in lowest terms.**\nThe fraction is $\\frac{5}{6}$. The numerator is 5, and the denominator is 6. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 6 is 1, as 5 is a prime number and 6 is not divisible by 5. Therefore, the fraction $\\frac{5}{6}$ is in lowest terms.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe sum expressed as a simple fraction in lowest terms is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$",
