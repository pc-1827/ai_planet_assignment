    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nDetermine the largest positive integer $n$ such that there exist positive integers $x, y, z$ satisfying the equation:\n\\[\nn^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2+2xy+2yz+2zx+3x+3y+3z-6\n\\]\nKey variables are $n, x, y, z$, which are positive integers. We want to maximize $n$.\n\n## Solution Strategy\nFirst, we simplify the given equation by recognizing the term $x^2+y^2+z^2+2xy+2yz+2zx$ as $(x+y+z)^2$. Let $s = x+y+z$. The equation becomes $n^2 = s^2 + 3s - 6$.\nSince $x, y, z$ are positive integers, the minimum value for $s = x+y+z$ is $1+1+1 = 3$. So we need to find the largest integer $n$ such that $n^2 = s^2 + 3s - 6$ for some integer $s \\ge 3$.\nWe can rewrite the equation as $n^2 - s^2 = 3s - 6$, or $(n-s)(n+s) = 3s - 6$.\nWe will analyze the relationship between $n$ and $s$ and find the conditions for $n$ to be an integer. We can also examine the range of values for $n^2$ for different values of $s$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Simplify the equation:**\n   The given equation is $n^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2+2xy+2yz+2zx+3x+3y+3z-6$.\n   We recognize that $x^2+y^2+z^2+2xy+2yz+2zx = (x+y+z)^2$.\n   So, the equation becomes $n^2 = (x+y+z)^2 + 3(x+y+z) - 6$.\n   Let $s = x+y+z$. Since $x, y, z$ are positive integers, $s \\ge 1+1+1 = 3$.\n   The equation is now $n^2 = s^2 + 3s - 6$.\n\n2. **Analyze the relationship between $n$ and $s$:**\n   We want to find the largest integer $n$ for which $n^2 = s^2 + 3s - 6$ for some integer $s \\ge 3$.\n   We compare $n^2$ with perfect squares around $s^2$.\n   Consider $(s+1)^2 = s^2 + 2s + 1$ and $(s+2)^2 = s^2 + 4s + 4$.\n   We want to see where $s^2 + 3s - 6$ lies relative to $(s+1)^2$ and $(s+2)^2$.\n   Compare $s^2 + 3s - 6$ with $(s+1)^2 = s^2 + 2s + 1$:\n   $s^2 + 3s - 6 \\ge s^2 + 2s + 1 \\implies 3s - 6 \\ge 2s + 1 \\implies s \\ge 7$.\n   Compare $s^2 + 3s - 6$ with $(s+2)^2 = s^2 + 4s + 4$:\n   $s^2 + 3s - 6 < s^2 + 4s + 4 \\implies 3s - 6 < 4s + 4 \\implies -10 < s$.\n   Since $s \\ge 3$, $s > -10$ is always true.\n\n3. **Consider the case $s=7$:**\n   When $s=7$, $n^2 = 7^2 + 3(7) - 6 = 49 + 21 - 6 = 64 = 8^2$.\n   So $n = 8$ is an integer solution when $s=7$.\n   We need to verify if there exist positive integers $x, y, z$ such that $x+y+z = 7$. Yes, for example, $x=1, y=1, z=5$.\n\n4. **Check for larger values of $s$:**\n   For $s \\ge 7$, we have $(s+1)^2 \\le s^2 + 3s - 6 < (s+2)^2$.\n   For $s > 7$, we have $(s+1)^2 < s^2 + 3s - 6 < (s+2)^2$.\n   This means that for $s > 7$, $s^2 + 3s - 6$ is strictly between two consecutive perfect squares $(s+1)^2$ and $(s+2)^2$.\n   Therefore, $s^2 + 3s - 6$ cannot be a perfect square when $s > 7$.\n   To confirm, let's check if $s^2 + 3s - 6 = (s+1)^2$ for any integer $s$.\n   $s^2 + 3s - 6 = s^2 + 2s + 1 \\implies 3s - 6 = 2s + 1 \\implies s = 7$.\n   So, $s^2 + 3s - 6 = (s+1)^2$ if and only if $s = 7$.\n   For $s=7$, $n^2 = (7+1)^2 = 8^2$, so $n=8$.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The largest integer value of $n$ occurs when $s=7$, and in this case $n=8$. For $s > 7$, $n^2 = s^2 + 3s - 6$ is not a perfect square.\n   Thus, the largest possible integer value for $n$ is $8$.\n\n## Final Answer\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   Find the largest positive integer $n$ such that there exist positive integers $x, y, z$ satisfying $n^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2+2xy+2yz+2zx+3x+3y+3z-6$. Here, $n, x, y, z$ are positive integers. We need to maximize $n$.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   Simplify the equation to $n^2 = (x+y+z)^2 + 3(x+y+z) - 6$. Let $s = x+y+z$. Then $n^2 = s^2 + 3s - 6$, where $s \\ge 3$. We analyze when $s^2 + 3s - 6$ is a perfect square for integer $s \\ge 3$, and find the largest possible value of $n$. We compare $s^2 + 3s - 6$ with nearby perfect squares $(s+1)^2$ and $(s+2)^2$.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - Let $s = x+y+z$. The equation becomes $n^2 = s^2 + 3s - 6$.\n   - We compare $n^2$ with $(s+1)^2 = s^2 + 2s + 1$.\n     $n^2 - (s+1)^2 = (s^2 + 3s - 6) - (s^2 + 2s + 1) = s - 7$.\n     If $s = 7$, $n^2 = (s+1)^2 = 8^2$, so $n=8$.\n     If $s > 7$, $n^2 > (s+1)^2$.\n   - We compare $n^2$ with $(s+2)^2 = s^2 + 4s + 4$.\n     $(s+2)^2 - n^2 = (s^2 + 4s + 4) - (s^2 + 3s - 6) = s + 10$.\n     Since $s \\ge 3$, $s+10 > 0$, so $(s+2)^2 > n^2$.\n   - Thus, for $s \\ge 7$, we have $(s+1)^2 \\le n^2 < (s+2)^2$.\n   - $n^2 = (s+1)^2$ only when $s-7 = 0$, i.e., $s=7$. In this case, $n = s+1 = 8$.\n   - For $s > 7$, $(s+1)^2 < n^2 < (s+2)^2$, so $n^2$ cannot be a perfect square.\n   - When $s=7$, we can choose $x=1, y=1, z=5$, which are positive integers.\n   - Therefore, the largest integer $n$ is $8$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The largest positive integer $n$ is $\\boxed{8}$",
