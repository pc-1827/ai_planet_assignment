    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nThe region in the $xy$-plane is defined by the set of points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the inequalities:\n$$|x - 3| \\le y \\le 4 - |x - 1|$$\nWe need to compute the area of this region.\nThe lower boundary of the region is given by the curve $y = |x - 3|$ and the upper boundary by the curve $y = 4 - |x - 1|$.\n\n## Solution Strategy\nTo find the area of the region, we will integrate the difference between the upper boundary function and the lower boundary function with respect to $x$, from the leftmost intersection point to the rightmost intersection point of the two curves.\nFirst, we need to find the intersection points of the curves $y = |x - 3|$ and $y = 4 - |x - 1|$.\nThen, we will set up the integral for the area as:\n$$Area = \\int_{a}^{b} [(4 - |x - 1|) - |x - 3|] dx$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points.\nTo evaluate the integral, we need to consider the piecewise definitions of the absolute value functions.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Find the intersection points of $y = |x - 3|$ and $y = 4 - |x - 1|$.**\n\nWe need to solve the equation $|x - 3| = 4 - |x - 1|$. We consider cases based on the signs of $x-3$ and $x-1$.\n\nCase 1: $x \\ge 3$. Then $x - 3 \\ge 0$ and $x - 1 \\ge 0$.\n$x - 3 = 4 - (x - 1)$\n$x - 3 = 4 - x + 1$\n$x - 3 = 5 - x$\n$2x = 8$\n$x = 4$.\nFor $x = 4$, $y = |4 - 3| = 1$. Intersection point is $(4, 1)$.\n\nCase 2: $1 \\le x < 3$. Then $x - 3 < 0$ and $x - 1 \\ge 0$.\n$-(x - 3) = 4 - (x - 1)$\n$3 - x = 4 - x + 1$\n$3 - x = 5 - x$\n$3 = 5$. No solution in this case.\n\nCase 3: $x < 1$. Then $x - 3 < 0$ and $x - 1 < 0$.\n$-(x - 3) = 4 - (-(x - 1))$\n$3 - x = 4 + (x - 1)$\n$3 - x = 4 + x - 1$\n$3 - x = 3 + x$\n$-x = x$\n$2x = 0$\n$x = 0$.\nFor $x = 0$, $y = |0 - 3| = 3$. Intersection point is $(0, 3)$.\n\nThe intersection points are $(0, 3)$ and $(4, 1)$. Thus, we need to integrate from $x = 0$ to $x = 4$.\n\n**2. Set up the integral for the area.**\n$$Area = \\int_{0}^{4} [(4 - |x - 1|) - |x - 3|] dx$$\n\n**3. Evaluate the integral by splitting it into intervals based on the absolute values.**\nWe need to consider the critical points $x = 1$ and $x = 3$. We split the integral into three parts: $[0, 1]$, $[1, 3]$, and $[3, 4]$.\n\nFor $0 \\le x \\le 1$: $|x - 1| = 1 - x$ and $|x - 3| = 3 - x$.\n$(4 - |x - 1|) - |x - 3| = (4 - (1 - x)) - (3 - x) = 4 - 1 + x - 3 + x = 2x$.\n$\\int_{0}^{1} 2x dx = [x^2]_{0}^{1} = 1^2 - 0^2 = 1$.\n\nFor $1 \\le x \\le 3$: $|x - 1| = x - 1$ and $|x - 3| = 3 - x$.\n$(4 - |x - 1|) - |x - 3| = (4 - (x - 1)) - (3 - x) = 4 - x + 1 - 3 + x = 2$.\n$\\int_{1}^{3} 2 dx = [2x]_{1}^{3} = 2(3) - 2(1) = 6 - 2 = 4$.\n\nFor $3 \\le x \\le 4$: $|x - 1| = x - 1$ and $|x - 3| = x - 3$.\n$(4 - |x - 1|) - |x - 3| = (4 - (x - 1)) - (x - 3) = 4 - x + 1 - x + 3 = 8 - 2x$.\n$\\int_{3}^{4} (8 - 2x) dx = [8x - x^2]_{3}^{4} = (8(4) - 4^2) - (8(3) - 3^2) = (32 - 16) - (24 - 9) = 16 - 15 = 1$.\n\n**4. Sum the areas from each interval.**\nTotal Area = $1 + 4 + 1 = 6$.\n\n## Final Answer\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   - Determine the area of the region in the $xy$-plane defined by the inequalities $|x - 3| \\le y \\le 4 - |x - 1|$.\n   - Key variables: $x, y$.
