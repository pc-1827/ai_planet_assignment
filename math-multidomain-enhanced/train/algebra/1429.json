    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nThe planet Xavier orbits its sun in an elliptical path, with the sun located at one focus of the ellipse. At its closest approach to the sun (perigee), Xavier is 2 astronomical units (AU) away. At its furthest point (apogee), it is 12 AU away. We need to calculate the distance from Xavier to the sun when Xavier is at a point midway along its orbit, where \"midway\" is interpreted as a point such that the angle from the perigee direction, as seen from the sun, is 90 degrees.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Orbit is elliptical with sun at one focus.\n- Perigee distance ($r_p$) = 2 AU.\n- Apogee distance ($r_a$) = 12 AU.\n- We need to find the distance ($r$) at an angle $\\theta = 90^\\circ = \\pi/2$ from perigee.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the properties of an ellipse and its polar equation to solve this problem.\nThe steps are:\n1. Determine the semi-major axis ($a$) and eccentricity ($e$) of the ellipse from the given perigee and apogee distances.\n2. Use the polar equation of an ellipse with the sun at the focus: $r = \\frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e \\cos \\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the perigee direction.\n3. Substitute $\\theta = \\pi/2$ into the polar equation to find the distance at the \"midway\" point.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Perigee distance: $r_p = a(1-e)$\n- Apogee distance: $r_a = a(1+e)$\n- Polar equation of ellipse: $r = \\frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e \\cos \\theta}$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Find the semi-major axis ($a$) and eccentricity ($e$).**\nWe are given:\n$r_p = a(1-e) = 2$  (Equation 1)\n$r_a = a(1+e) = 12$ (Equation 2)\n\nAdding Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n$r_p + r_a = a(1-e) + a(1+e) = 2a$\n$2 + 12 = 2a$\n$14 = 2a$\n$a = \\frac{14}{2} = 7$ AU\n\nSubtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n$r_a - r_p = a(1+e) - a(1-e) = 2ae$\n$12 - 2 = 2ae$\n$10 = 2ae$\n$e = \\frac{10}{2a} = \\frac{10}{2 \\times 7} = \\frac{10}{14} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nSo, the semi-major axis $a = 7$ AU and eccentricity $e = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the polar equation of the ellipse.**\nThe polar equation of an ellipse with the focus at the origin is $r = \\frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e \\cos \\theta}$.\nWe need to find the distance $r$ when Xavier is midway along its orbit, which corresponds to $\\theta = \\pi/2$.\n\nSubstitute $\\theta = \\pi/2$ into the polar equation:\n$r = \\frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e \\cos(\\pi/2)}$\nSince $\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0$, the equation simplifies to:\n$r = \\frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e \\times 0} = a(1-e^2)$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the distance $r$.**\nWe have $a = 7$ and $e = \\frac{5}{7}$.\nFirst, calculate $e^2$:\n$e^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49}$\n\nThen, calculate $1-e^2$:\n$1-e^2 = 1 - \\frac{25}{49} = \\frac{49 - 25}{49} = \\frac{24}{49}$\n\nFinally, calculate $r$:\n$r = a(1-e^2) = 7 \\times \\frac{24}{49} = \\frac{7 \\times 24}{49} = \\frac{24}{7}$ AU\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe distance from Xavier to the sun when it is midway along its orbit is $\\frac{24}{7}$ AU.\n\nWe can check if this value is between perigee and apogee distances (2 AU and 12 AU).\n$\\frac{24}{7} \\approx 3.43$ AU, which is indeed between 2 AU and 12 AU.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{24}{7} \\text{ AU}}$",
