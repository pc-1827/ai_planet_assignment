Problem Statement\nFind the distance between the foci of the ellipse given by the equation\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{20} + \\frac{y^2}{4} = 7.\\]\nThe key variables are the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms, and the constant on the right side of the equation. We need to find the distance between the foci of this ellipse.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nTo find the distance between the foci, we first need to rewrite the equation of the ellipse in its standard form: $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$. From the standard form, we can identify the semi-major axis $a$ and semi-minor axis $b$. Then, we can calculate the distance from the center to each focus, denoted by $c$, using the relationship $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$ (assuming $a > b$). The distance between the foci is then $2c$.\n\nRelevant formulas and theorems:\n- Standard equation of an ellipse centered at the origin: $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$.\n- Relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$ for an ellipse: $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$ (where $a \\ge b$).\n- Distance between foci is $2c$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n**Step 1: Convert the given equation to the standard form.**\nThe given equation is $\\frac{x^2}{20} + \\frac{y^2}{4} = 7$.\nTo get the standard form, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{x^2}{20}}{7} + \\frac{\\frac{y^2}{4}}{7} = \\frac{7}{7}\\]\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{20 \\times 7} + \\frac{y^2}{4 \\times 7} = 1\\]\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{140} + \\frac{y^2}{28} = 1\\]\n\n**Step 2: Identify $a^2$ and $b^2$.**\nFrom the standard form equation $\\frac{x^2}{140} + \\frac{y^2}{28} = 1$, we can identify:\n$a^2 = 140$ and $b^2 = 28$.\nSince $a^2 > b^2$, the major axis is along the x-axis.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate $c^2$.**\nWe use the relationship $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$ to find $c^2$:\n$c^2 = 140 - 28 = 112$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $c$.**\n$c = \\sqrt{112} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 7} = \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{7} = 4\\sqrt{7}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the distance between the foci.**\nThe distance between the foci is $2c$.\nDistance $= 2c = 2 \\times 4\\sqrt{7} = 8\\sqrt{7}$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe distance between the foci of the ellipse is $\\boxed{8\\sqrt{7}}$.\n\nVerification:\nThe standard form of the ellipse is $\\frac{x^2}{140} + \\frac{y^2}{28} = 1$.\nHere $a^2 = 140$ and $b^2 = 28$. Since $a^2 > b^2$, the major axis is along the x-axis.\n$c^2 = a^2 - b^2 = 140 - 28 = 112$.\n$c = \\sqrt{112} = 4\\sqrt{7}$.\nThe foci are at $(\\pm c, 0) = (\\pm 4\\sqrt{7}, 0)$.\nThe distance between the foci is $2c = 2 \\times 4\\sqrt{7} = 8\\sqrt{7}$.\nThe answer is consistent with all steps and formulas used.",
