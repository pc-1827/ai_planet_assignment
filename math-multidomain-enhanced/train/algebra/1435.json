    "solution": "## Solution:\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   - Given the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1$ with a focus at $F = (1,0).$\n   - We need to find a point $P = (p,0)$ with $p > 0$ such that for any chord $\\overline{AB}$ passing through $F,$ $\\angle APF = \\angle BPF.$\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   - The condition $\\angle APF = \\angle BPF$ implies that $PF$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle APB.$ By the Angle Bisector Theorem, this means $\\frac{PA}{PB} = \\frac{AF}{BF}.$\n   - We will use the coordinates of points $A = (x_1, y_1),$ $B = (x_2, y_2),$ $F = (1, 0),$ and $P = (p, 0).$\n   - The condition $\\frac{PA}{PB} = \\frac{AF}{BF}$ must hold for any chord $\\overline{AB}$ through $F.$\n   - We will use the equation of a line passing through $F = (1,0)$ to represent the chord $\\overline{AB},$ and find the intersection points $A$ and $B$ with the ellipse.\n   - Then we will substitute the coordinates of $A, B, P, F$ into the condition $\\frac{PA}{PB} = \\frac{AF}{BF}$ to find $p.$\n   - Alternatively, we can use the condition that the slopes of $PA$ and $PB$ are symmetric with respect to the x-axis (since $PF$ lies on the x-axis).\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - Let $A = (x_1, y_1)$ and $B = (x_2, y_2)$ be the endpoints of a chord passing through $F = (1, 0).$ Let $P = (p, 0).$ The condition $\\angle APF = \\angle BPF$ is equivalent to the reflection of the line $PA$ across the x-axis being the line $PB.$  This means if the slope of $PA$ is $m,$ then the slope of $PB$ is $-m.$\n   - Slope of $PA = \\frac{y_1 - 0}{x_1 - p} = \\frac{y_1}{x_1 - p}.$\n   - Slope of $PB = \\frac{y_2 - 0}{x_2 - p} = \\frac{y_2}{x_2 - p}.$\n   - We require $\\frac{y_2}{x_2 - p} = - \\frac{y_1}{x_1 - p},$ which means $y_2 (x_1 - p) = - y_1 (x_2 - p),$ or $y_2 (x_1 - p) + y_1 (x_2 - p) = 0.$\n   - Since the chord passes through $F = (1, 0),$ the line equation is $y = m(x - 1).$\n   - Substituting into the ellipse equation $\\frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1,$ we get $\\frac{x^2}{2} + m^2 (x - 1)^2 = 1.$\n   - $x^2 + 2m^2 (x - 1)^2 = 2 \\implies x^2 + 2m^2 (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 2 \\implies (1 + 2m^2) x^2 - 4m^2 x + 2m^2 - 2 = 0.$\n   - Let $x_1, x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. Then $x_1 + x_2 = \\frac{4m^2}{1 + 2m^2}$ and $x_1 x_2 = \\frac{2m^2 - 2}{1 + 2m^2}.$\n   - Also, $y_1 = m(x_1 - 1)$ and $y_2 = m(x_2 - 1).$\n   - Substitute into $y_2 (x_1 - p) + y_1 (x_2 - p) = 0.$\n   - $m(x_2 - 1) (x_1 - p) + m(x_1 - 1) (x_2 - p) = 0.$ Since $m$ can be non-zero for a general chord, we divide by $m.$\n   - $(x_2 - 1) (x_1 - p) + (x_1 - 1) (x_2 - p) = 0.$\n   - $x_1 x_2 - px_2 - x_1 + p + x_1 x_2 - px_1 - x_2 + p = 0.$\n   - $2 x_1 x_2 - p(x_1 + x_2) - (x_1 + x_2) + 2p = 0.$\n   - $2 x_1 x_2 - (p+1)(x_1 + x_2) + 2p = 0.$\n   - Substitute $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1 x_2$ in terms of $m.$\n   - $2 \\frac{2m^2 - 2}{1 + 2m^2} - (p+1) \\frac{4m^2}{1 + 2m^2} + 2p = 0.$\n   - Multiply by $1 + 2m^2:$ $2 (2m^2 - 2) - (p+1) 4m^2 + 2p (1 + 2m^2) = 0.$\n   - $4m^2 - 4 - 4pm^2 - 4m^2 + 2p + 4pm^2 = 0.$\n   - $- 4 + 2p = 0 \\implies 2p = 4 \\implies p = 2.$\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   - The value of $p$ is $2.$\n   - Verify: If $p = 2,$ then the condition is satisfied for any chord. The point $P = (2, 0)$ is the intersection of the directrix $x = a^2/c = 2/1 = 2$ with the major axis. For an ellipse, the intersection of the directrix with the major axis has the property that it bisects the angle between the focal radii to any point on the ellipse. In this case, we require the point to bisect the angle for any chord through the focus, which means it must be this directrix intersection.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",
