    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n### 1. Problem Statement\n- **Rewrite the problem in clear terms:**\nThe given rational function $y=\\frac{x^3+8x^2+21x+18}{x+2}$ can be simplified to a quadratic function of the form $y=Ax^2+Bx+C$, except at a specific value of $x$, which is $x=D$. We are asked to find the sum of the coefficients $A$, $B$, $C$ and the excluded value $D$.\n- **Highlight key variables and constraints:**\n  - Rational function: $y=\\frac{x^3+8x^2+21x+18}{x+2}$\n  - Simplified quadratic form: $y=Ax^2+Bx+C$\n  - Excluded value: $x=D$ where the original function is undefined.\n  - Objective: Find the sum $A+B+C+D$.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\n- **Approach:**\n  First, identify the value of $x$ for which the original function is undefined. This will be $D$. Then, simplify the rational function by dividing the numerator polynomial by the denominator polynomial. The quotient will be in the form $Ax^2+Bx+C$. Finally, calculate the sum $A+B+C+D$.\n- **Relevant formulas/theorems:**\n  - A rational function is undefined when its denominator is zero.\n  - Polynomial long division or synthetic division can be used to divide polynomials.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n- **Step 1: Find the value of D.**\n  The function $y=\\frac{x^3+8x^2+21x+18}{x+2}$ is undefined when the denominator $x+2=0$.\n  Solving for $x$, we get $x = -2$.\n  Therefore, $D = -2$.\n\n- **Step 2: Simplify the rational function by polynomial division.**\n  We will divide the numerator $x^3+8x^2+21x+18$ by the denominator $x+2$ using polynomial long division or synthetic division. Let's use polynomial long division:\n\n```\n        x^2 + 6x + 9\n      ________________\nx+2 |  x^3 + 8x^2 + 21x + 18\n      -(x^3 + 2x^2)\n      ________________\n            6x^2 + 21x\n          -(6x^2 + 12x)\n          ________________\n                  9x + 18\n                -(9x + 18)\n                _________\n                       0\n```\nThe quotient is $x^2+6x+9$ and the remainder is $0$.\nThus, $\\frac{x^3+8x^2+21x+18}{x+2} = x^2+6x+9$ for $x \\neq -2$.\n\n- **Step 3: Identify A, B, and C.**\n  Comparing the quotient $x^2+6x+9$ with the form $Ax^2+Bx+C$, we have:\n  $A = 1$ (coefficient of $x^2$)\n  $B = 6$ (coefficient of $x$)\n  $C = 9$ (constant term)\n\n- **Step 4: Calculate the sum $A+B+C+D$.**\n  We have $A=1$, $B=6$, $C=9$, and $D=-2$.\n  Sum = $A+B+C+D = 1 + 6 + 9 + (-2) = 16 - 2 = 14$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\n- **Present result in boxed{answer} format:**\n  The sum of the values of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ is $14$.\n\n  $\\boxed{14}$\n\n- **Verify the answer satisfies all conditions:**\n  - The function $y=\\frac{x^3+8x^2+21x+18}{x+2}$ is indeed simplified to $y=x^2+6x+9$ for all $x \\neq -2$.\n  - The function $y=x^2+6x+9$ is in the form $y=Ax^2+Bx+C$ with $A=1$, $B=6$, $C=9$.\n  - The original function is undefined at $x=-2$, so $D=-2$.\n  - The sum $A+B+C+D = 1+6+9-2 = 14$.\n\n- **Include units if applicable:**\n  No units are applicable in this problem.",
