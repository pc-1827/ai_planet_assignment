    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nFind the number of ordered quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ of nonnegative real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 &= 4 \\\\ (a + b + c + d)(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) &= 16\\end{align*}\nThe variables are $a,b,c,d$, and they are constrained to be nonnegative real numbers. We need to find the total number of ordered quadruples that satisfy both equations.\n\n### Solution Strategy\nWe will use Lagrange multipliers to explore the possible values of $a,b,c,d$ that could minimize or maximize $S_1 = a+b+c+d$ and $S_3 = a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3$ under the constraint $S_2 = a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 = 4$. We will then check which combinations satisfy the second equation $S_1 S_3 = 16$.\n\nWe can consider the problem of minimizing/maximizing $f(a,b,c,d) = a+b+c+d$ subject to $g(a,b,c,d) = a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 - 4 = 0$. Using Lagrange multipliers, we found that the possible solutions have components that are either 0 or equal to some constant $k$.\n\nLet's assume that among $a,b,c,d$, there are $n$ non-zero values, and let these non-zero values be equal to some $k > 0$. Then $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 = n k^2 = 4$, so $k^2 = 4/n$, and $k = 2/\\sqrt{n}$.\nAlso, $a+b+c+d = n k = n \\times \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}} = 2\\sqrt{n}$.\nAnd $a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3 = n k^3 = n \\times (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}})^3 = n \\times \\frac{8}{n\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\nThen $(a+b+c+d)(a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3) = (2\\sqrt{n})(\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{n}}) = 16$.\nThis means for any number $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ of non-zero components, we can find a solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\nWe consider the possible values for the number of non-zero components, $n$, from 1 to 4.\n\nCase 1: $n=1$. One component is non-zero and equal to $k = 2/\\sqrt{1} = 2$, and the other three are zero. The solutions are permutations of $(2, 0, 0, 0)$. There are $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ such permutations.\n\nCase 2: $n=2$. Two components are non-zero and equal to $k = 2/\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}$, and the other two are zero. The solutions are permutations of $(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}, 0, 0)$. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$ such permutations.\n\nCase 3: $n=3$. Three components are non-zero and equal to $k = 2/\\sqrt{3}$, and the other one is zero. The solutions are permutations of $(2/\\sqrt{3}, 2/\\sqrt{3}, 2/\\sqrt{3}, 0)$. There are $\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4$ such permutations.\n\nCase 4: $n=4$. All four components are non-zero and equal to $k = 2/\\sqrt{4} = 1$. The solution is $(1, 1, 1, 1)$. There is $\\binom{4}{4} = 1$ such permutation.\n\nIn each case, the conditions $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4$ and $(a + b + c + d)(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) = 16$ are satisfied as shown in the derivation.\nThe total number of solutions is the sum of the number of permutations in each case: $4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of ordered quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ of nonnegative real numbers satisfying the given conditions is $\\boxed{15}$.",
