    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nAn ellipse is defined by its two foci, $F_1 = (0,2)$ and $F_2 = (3,0)$. This ellipse is known to intersect the $x$-axis at the origin $(0,0)$. We need to find the coordinates of the other point where the ellipse intersects the $x$-axis. Let this point be denoted as $(x,0)$.\n\n**Key variables and constraints:**\n- Foci: $F_1 = (0,2)$, $F_2 = (3,0)$\n- Ellipse passes through the origin $(0,0)$\n- Ellipse intersects the x-axis at another point $(x,0)$, where $x \\neq 0$.\n\n### Solution Strategy\nThe definition of an ellipse is the set of all points $P$ such that the sum of the distances from $P$ to the two foci is a constant, say $2a$.\nSince the origin $(0,0)$ is on the ellipse, we can calculate this constant sum using the origin and the given foci.\nOnce we have the constant sum, we can use the definition of the ellipse to find the other intersection point with the x-axis, which is of the form $(x,0)$. We will set up an equation using the distance formula and solve for $x$.\n\nRelevant formula:\n- Distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$: $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$\n- Definition of ellipse: $PF_1 + PF_2 = 2a$\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the constant sum of distances ($2a$) using the origin.**\nLet $P = (0,0)$, $F_1 = (0,2)$, $F_2 = (3,0)$.\n$PF_1 = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n$PF_2 = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.\nThe constant sum $2a = PF_1 + PF_2 = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the equation for the other intersection point $(x,0)$.**\nLet $P = (x,0)$, $F_1 = (0,2)$, $F_2 = (3,0)$.\n$PF_1 = \\sqrt{(0-x)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$.\n$PF_2 = \\sqrt{(3-x)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(3-x)^2} = |3-x|$.\nAccording to the definition of the ellipse, $PF_1 + PF_2 = 2a = 5$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + |3-x| = 5$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation for $x$.**\nWe consider two cases based on the absolute value $|3-x|$.\n\nCase 1: $3-x \\ge 0$, which means $x \\le 3$. In this case, $|3-x| = 3-x$.\nThe equation becomes $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + (3-x) = 5$.\n$\\sqrt{x^2 + 4} = 5 - (3-x) = 5 - 3 + x = 2 + x$.\nSquare both sides:\n$x^2 + 4 = (2+x)^2 = 4 + 4x + x^2$.\n$x^2 + 4 = 4 + 4x + x^2$.\n$4 = 4 + 4x$.\n$0 = 4x$.\n$x = 0$.\nThis is the origin, which is one intersection point, but we are looking for the other intersection point.\n\nCase 2: $3-x < 0$, which means $x > 3$. In this case, $|3-x| = -(3-x) = x-3$.\nThe equation becomes $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + (x-3) = 5$.\n$\\sqrt{x^2 + 4} = 5 - (x-3) = 5 - x + 3 = 8 - x$.\nSquare both sides:\n$x^2 + 4 = (8-x)^2 = 64 - 16x + x^2$.\n$x^2 + 4 = 64 - 16x + x^2$.\n$4 = 64 - 16x$.\n$16x = 64 - 4 = 60$.\n$x = \\frac{60}{16} = \\frac{15}{4} = 3.75$.\nSince $x = 3.75 > 3$, this solution is consistent with our assumption for Case 2.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the solution is valid.**\nFor $x = \\frac{15}{4}$, the point is $(\\frac{15}{4}, 0)$.\n$PF_1 = \\sqrt{(\\frac{15}{4})^2 + 4} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{16} + \\frac{64}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{289}{16}} = \\frac{17}{4}$.\n$PF_2 = |3 - \\frac{15}{4}| = |\\frac{12}{4} - \\frac{15}{4}| = |-\\frac{3}{4}| = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n$PF_1 + PF_2 = \\frac{17}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{20}{4} = 5 = 2a$.\nThe sum of distances is indeed 5, so $(\\frac{15}{4}, 0)$ is on the ellipse.\n\nThe other point of intersection with the x-axis is $(\\frac{15}{4}, 0)$.\n\n### Final Answer\n1. **Problem Statement**\nAn ellipse is defined by its foci $F_1 = (0,2)$ and $F_2 = (3,0)$. The ellipse intersects the x-axis at the origin. Determine the coordinates of the other point where the ellipse intersects the x-axis.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\nWe will use the definition of an ellipse: the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. We first find this constant using the given intersection point at the origin. Then, we use this constant sum to find the other intersection point on the x-axis, which has the form $(x,0)$.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n- The sum of distances from a point on the ellipse to the foci is constant. Using the origin $(0,0)$, we calculate this constant:\n  $2a = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} + \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{9} = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n- Let the other intersection point with the x-axis be $(x,0)$. The sum of distances from $(x,0)$ to the foci must also be $5$:\n  $\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} + \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (0-0)^2} = 5$\n  $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + |x-3| = 5$\n- We consider two cases for the absolute value:\n  Case 1: $x-3 \\ge 0 \\implies x \\ge 3$. Then $|x-3| = x-3$.\n  $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + (x-3) = 5 \\implies \\sqrt{x^2 + 4} = 8-x$.\n  Squaring both sides: $x^2 + 4 = (8-x)^2 = 64 - 16x + x^2 \\implies 4 = 64 - 16x \\implies 16x = 60 \\implies x = \\frac{60}{16} = \\frac{15}{4}$. Since $\\frac{15}{4} = 3.75 \\ge 3$, this is a valid solution.\n  Case 2: $x-3 < 0 \\implies x < 3$. Then $|x-3| = 3-x$.\n  $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + (3-x) = 5 \\implies \\sqrt{x^2 + 4} = 2+x$.\n  Squaring both sides: $x^2 + 4 = (2+x)^2 = 4 + 4x + x^2 \\implies 4 = 4 + 4x \\implies 4x = 0 \\implies x = 0$. This corresponds to the origin, which is already given.\n- Thus, the other intersection point is at $x = \\frac{15}{4}$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\nThe other point of intersection is $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{15}{4}, 0\\right)}$",
