    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nSuppose that all four of the numbers $2 - \\sqrt{5}, \\;4+\\sqrt{10}, \\;14 - 2\\sqrt{7}, \\;-\\sqrt{2}$ are roots of the same nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients. What is the smallest possible degree of the polynomial?\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- We are given four numbers: $r_1 = 2 - \\sqrt{5}, r_2 = 4+\\sqrt{10}, r_3 = 14 - 2\\sqrt{7}, r_4 = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n- These numbers are roots of a nonzero polynomial $P(x)$.\n- The coefficients of $P(x)$ are rational numbers.\n- We want to find the smallest possible degree of $P(x)$.\n\n## Solution Strategy\nWe will use the property that if a polynomial with rational coefficients has a root of the form $a + \\sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are rational and $\\sqrt{b}$ is irrational, then its conjugate $a - \\sqrt{b}$ must also be a root.\nFor each given root, we will find its conjugate and determine the set of all roots that must be present for a polynomial with rational coefficients.\nThen we will count the number of distinct roots to find the smallest possible degree of the polynomial.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Consider the root $r_1 = 2 - \\sqrt{5}$**.\n   Here $a = 2$ and $b = 5$. The conjugate of $r_1$ is $2 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n   So, if $2 - \\sqrt{5}$ is a root, then $2 + \\sqrt{5}$ must also be a root.\n\n2. **Consider the root $r_2 = 4 + \\sqrt{10}$**.\n   Here $a = 4$ and $b = 10$. The conjugate of $r_2$ is $4 - \\sqrt{10}$.\n   So, if $4 + \\sqrt{10}$ is a root, then $4 - \\sqrt{10}$ must also be a root.\n\n3. **Consider the root $r_3 = 14 - 2\\sqrt{7} = 14 - \\sqrt{28}$**.\n   Here $a = 14$ and $b = 28$. The conjugate of $r_3$ is $14 + 2\\sqrt{7} = 14 + \\sqrt{28}$.\n   So, if $14 - 2\\sqrt{7}$ is a root, then $14 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ must also be a root.\n\n4. **Consider the root $r_4 = -\\sqrt{2} = 0 - \\sqrt{2}$**.\n   Here $a = 0$ and $b = 2$. The conjugate of $r_4$ is $0 + \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n   So, if $-\\sqrt{2}$ is a root, then $\\sqrt{2}$ must also be a root.\n\n5. **List all the roots that must be present**:\n   - If $2 - \\sqrt{5}$ is a root, then $2 + \\sqrt{5}$ is also a root.\n   - If $4 + \\sqrt{10}$ is a root, then $4 - \\sqrt{10}$ is also a root.\n   - If $14 - 2\\sqrt{7}$ is a root, then $14 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ is also a root.\n   - If $-\\sqrt{2}$ is a root, then $\\sqrt{2}$ is also a root.\n\n   So the polynomial must have at least the following roots:\n   $\\{2 - \\sqrt{5}, \\;2 + \\sqrt{5}, \\;4+\\sqrt{10}, \\;4-\\sqrt{10}, \\;14 - 2\\sqrt{7}, \\;14 + 2\\sqrt{7}, \\;-\\sqrt{2}, \\;\\sqrt{2}\\}$\n\n6. **Check if these roots are distinct**.\n   Approximate values:\n   $2 - \\sqrt{5} \\approx -0.236$\n   $2 + \\sqrt{5} \\approx 4.236$\n   $4 + \\sqrt{10} \\approx 7.162$\n   $4 - \\sqrt{10} \\approx 0.838$\n   $14 - 2\\sqrt{7} \\approx 8.708$\n   $14 + 2\\sqrt{7} \\approx 19.292$\n   $-\\sqrt{2} \\approx -1.414$\n   $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n\n   All 8 values are distinct.\n\n7. **Determine the smallest possible degree**.\n   Since we have found 8 distinct roots that must be roots of the polynomial, the smallest possible degree of the polynomial is the number of these distinct roots, which is 8.\n   We can construct a polynomial of degree 8 with rational coefficients having these roots by multiplying the quadratic factors corresponding to each conjugate pair:\n   $P(x) = (x^2 - 4x - 1)(x^2 - 8x + 6)(x^2 - 28x + 168)(x^2 - 2)$.\n   Each quadratic factor has rational coefficients, so their product will also have rational coefficients.\n\n## Final Answer\n4. **Final Answer**\n\nThe smallest possible degree of the polynomial is $\\boxed{8}$",
