    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\n- Rewrite the problem in clear terms\nThe equation given is $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + |y-1| = 3$. We are told that the graph of this equation consists of portions of two different parabolas. We need to find the distance between the vertices of these two parabolas.\n\n- Highlight key variables and constraints\nThe key variables are $x$ and $y$ in the given equation. The constraint is the equation itself, which involves a square root and an absolute value.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\n- Explain your approach\nWe will consider two cases based on the definition of the absolute value $|y-1|$.\nCase 1: $y-1 \\ge 0$, which means $y \\ge 1$. In this case, $|y-1| = y-1$.\nCase 2: $y-1 < 0$, which means $y < 1$. In this case, $|y-1| = -(y-1) = 1-y$.\nFor each case, we will simplify the equation to the form of a parabola and find its vertex. Finally, we will calculate the distance between the vertices of the two parabolas.\n\n- List relevant formulas/theorems\nThe standard form of a parabola opening vertically is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.\nThe distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the distance formula $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n**Case 1:** $y-1 \\ge 0 \\implies y \\ge 1$.\nIn this case, $|y-1| = y-1$. The equation becomes:\n$\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + (y-1) = 3$\n$\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = 3 - (y-1) = 4-y$\nFor the square root to be defined and non-negative, we need $4-y \\ge 0$, which means $y \\le 4$. Combining with $y \\ge 1$, we have $1 \\le y \\le 4$.\nSquare both sides:\n$x^2+y^2 = (4-y)^2$\n$x^2+y^2 = 16 - 8y + y^2$\n$x^2 = 16 - 8y$\n$8y = 16 - x^2$\n$y = \\frac{16 - x^2}{8} = 2 - \\frac{1}{8}x^2 = -\\frac{1}{8}x^2 + 2$\nThis is a parabola opening downwards. The vertex form is $y = -\\frac{1}{8}(x-0)^2 + 2$.\nSo the vertex of the first parabola is $V_1 = (0, 2)$.\n\n**Case 2:** $y-1 < 0 \\implies y < 1$.\nIn this case, $|y-1| = -(y-1) = 1-y$. The equation becomes:\n$\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + (1-y) = 3$\n$\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = 3 - (1-y) = 3 - 1 + y = 2+y$\nFor the square root to be defined and non-negative, we need $2+y \\ge 0$, which means $y \\ge -2$. Combining with $y < 1$, we have $-2 \\le y < 1$.\nSquare both sides:\n$x^2+y^2 = (2+y)^2$\n$x^2+y^2 = 4 + 4y + y^2$\n$x^2 = 4 + 4y$\n$4y = x^2 - 4$\n$y = \\frac{x^2 - 4}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 1 = \\frac{1}{4}(x-0)^2 - 1$\nThis is a parabola opening upwards. The vertex form is $y = \\frac{1}{4}(x-0)^2 - 1$.\nSo the vertex of the second parabola is $V_2 = (0, -1)$.\n\nNow we compute the distance between the vertices $V_1 = (0, 2)$ and $V_2 = (0, -1)$.\nDistance $= \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (-1-2)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\n- Present result in boxed{answer} format\nThe distance between the vertices of the parabolas is $3$.\n\n- Verify the answer satisfies all conditions\nWe have derived the equations of two parabolas and found their vertices. We calculated the distance between these vertices. The steps are logically sound and mathematically correct.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",
