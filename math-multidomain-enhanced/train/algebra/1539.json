    "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\n1. **Problem Statement:**\nFind the equation of the directrix of the parabola given by the equation $y = 8x^2 + 2$.\n2. **Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- The equation of the parabola is given as $y = 8x^2 + 2$.\n- We need to find the equation of the directrix, which is a line.\n- For a parabola in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, it opens upwards if $a > 0$ and downwards if $a < 0$. Here, $a=8 > 0$, so the parabola opens upwards.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\n1. **Convert to Standard Form:** Rewrite the given equation of the parabola into the standard form $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola and $p$ is the distance between the vertex and the focus, and also the distance between the vertex and the directrix.\n2. **Identify Vertex and 4p:** From the standard form, identify the coordinates of the vertex $(h, k)$ and the value of $4p$.\n3. **Calculate p:** Solve for $p$ from $4p$.\n4. **Determine Directrix Equation:** For a parabola that opens upwards with vertex $(h, k)$, the equation of the directrix is given by $y = k - p$.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Convert to Standard Form:**\nGiven equation: $y = 8x^2 + 2$\nSubtract 2 from both sides: $y - 2 = 8x^2$\nDivide both sides by 8: $\\frac{1}{8}(y - 2) = x^2$\nRewrite in standard form: $(x - 0)^2 = \\frac{1}{8}(y - 2)$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$, we have:\n$h = 0$\n$k = 2$\n$4p = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\n2. **Identify Vertex and 4p:**\nVertex $(h, k) = (0, 2)$\n$4p = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\n3. **Calculate p:**\n$4p = \\frac{1}{8}$\nDivide by 4 to find $p$:\n$p = \\frac{1}{8 \\times 4} = \\frac{1}{32}$\nSince $p = \\frac{1}{32} > 0$, the parabola opens upwards, as expected from the coefficient of $x^2$ being positive.\n\n4. **Determine Directrix Equation:**\nFor a parabola opening upwards with vertex $(h, k)$, the equation of the directrix is $y = k - p$.\nSubstituting the values of $k = 2$ and $p = \\frac{1}{32}$:\n$y = 2 - \\frac{1}{32}$\nTo subtract the fraction, we need a common denominator, which is 32:\n$y = \\frac{2 \\times 32}{32} - \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{64}{32} - \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{64 - 1}{32} = \\frac{63}{32}$\nSo, the equation of the directrix is $y = \\frac{63}{32}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n4. **Final Answer**\nThe equation of the directrix of the parabola $y = 8x^2 + 2$ is $y = \\frac{63}{32}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{y = \\frac{63}{32}}$",
