    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n- Rewrite the problem in clear terms\nWe are given a piecewise function $f(x)$ defined as:\n\\[f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nx + 3 & \\text{if $x < 20$}, \\\\\n2x - 2 & \\text{if $x \\ge 20$}.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]\nWe are asked to find the sum of the inverse function values at $y=7$ and $y=46$, which is $f^{-1}(7) + f^{-1}(46).$\n\n- Highlight key variables and constraints\nThe function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function defined differently for $x < 20$ and $x \\ge 20$. We need to find the inverse function values for specific $y$ values.\n\n## Solution Strategy\n- Explain your approach\nTo find $f^{-1}(7)$ and $f^{-1}(46)$, we need to determine which piece of the function was used to obtain the output values $7$ and $46$. For each given $y$ value, we need to check which condition on $x$ (i.e., $x < 20$ or $x \\ge 20$) would result in the given $y$ value. Then we solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ for the corresponding piece to find the inverse function value.\n\n- List relevant formulas/theorems\nFor a function $y = f(x)$, the inverse function $f^{-1}(y)$ is found by solving for $x$ in terms of $y$. For a piecewise function, we need to consider each piece separately and determine the domain and range of each piece and its inverse.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n- Show each mathematical step\n- Explain your reasoning\n- Include intermediate calculations\n\nFirst, let's find $f^{-1}(7)$. We want to find $x$ such that $f(x) = 7$.\nCase 1: Assume $x < 20$. Then $f(x) = x + 3$. We set $x + 3 = 7$, which gives $x = 7 - 3 = 4$. Since $4 < 20$, this assumption is valid. Therefore, $f^{-1}(7) = 4$.\n\nCase 2: Assume $x \\ge 20$. Then $f(x) = 2x - 2$. We set $2x - 2 = 7$, which gives $2x = 9$, so $x = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5$. However, we assumed $x \\ge 20$, and $4.5 < 20$. So this case does not give a valid solution for $f^{-1}(7)$.\n\nThus, we have $f^{-1}(7) = 4$.\n\nNext, let's find $f^{-1}(46)$. We want to find $x$ such that $f(x) = 46$.\nCase 1: Assume $x < 20$. Then $f(x) = x + 3$. We set $x + 3 = 46$, which gives $x = 46 - 3 = 43$. However, we assumed $x < 20$, and $43 \\ge 20$. So this case does not give a valid solution for $f^{-1}(46)$.\n\nCase 2: Assume $x \\ge 20$. Then $f(x) = 2x - 2$. We set $2x - 2 = 46$, which gives $2x = 48$, so $x = \\frac{48}{2} = 24$. Since $24 \\ge 20$, this assumption is valid. Therefore, $f^{-1}(46) = 24$.\n\nThus, we have $f^{-1}(46) = 24$.\n\nFinally, we need to compute $f^{-1}(7) + f^{-1}(46)$.\n$f^{-1}(7) + f^{-1}(46) = 4 + 24 = 28$.\n\n## Final Answer\n- Present result in  oxed{answer} format\n- Verify the answer satisfies all conditions\n- Include units if applicable\n\nWe found $f^{-1}(7) = 4$ and $f^{-1}(46) = 24$.\nLet's verify these values.\nFor $f^{-1}(7) = 4$, we check $f(4)$. Since $4 < 20$, we use the first piece: $f(4) = 4 + 3 = 7$. This is correct.\nFor $f^{-1}(46) = 24$, we check $f(24)$. Since $24 \\ge 20$, we use the second piece: $f(24) = 2(24) - 2 = 48 - 2 = 46$. This is correct.\n\nTherefore, $f^{-1}(7) + f^{-1}(46) = 4 + 24 = 28$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{28}$",
