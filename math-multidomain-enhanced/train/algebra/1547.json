    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\n\nWe are asked to solve the quadratic inequality\n\\[-4x^2 + 7x + 2 < 0.\\]\nWe need to find all real values of $x$ for which the expression $-4x^2 + 7x + 2$ is strictly less than zero. The variable is $x$, and the constraint is that the quadratic expression must be negative.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\n\nTo solve this quadratic inequality, we will first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation $-4x^2 + 7x + 2 = 0$. These roots will divide the real number line into intervals. We will then test a value from each interval to determine where the inequality $-4x^2 + 7x + 2 < 0$ holds.\n\nWe will use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, which is given by\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\\]\nIn our case, $a = -4$, $b = 7$, and $c = 2$.\n\nAfter finding the roots, we will analyze the intervals defined by these roots. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative ($a = -4 < 0$), the parabola opens downwards. Thus, the quadratic expression will be negative outside the interval between the roots.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Find the roots of the quadratic equation $-4x^2 + 7x + 2 = 0$.**\nUsing the quadratic formula with $a = -4$, $b = 7$, and $c = 2$:\n\\[x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4(-4)(2)}}{2(-4)}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 32}}{-8}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{81}}{-8}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{-7 \\pm 9}{-8}\\]\nWe have two roots:\n\\[x_1 = \\frac{-7 + 9}{-8} = \\frac{2}{-8} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\\[x_2 = \\frac{-7 - 9}{-8} = \\frac{-16}{-8} = 2\\]\nThe roots are $x = -\\frac{1}{4}$ and $x = 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the intervals and test values.**\nThe roots $x = -\\frac{1}{4}$ and $x = 2$ divide the real number line into three intervals: $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4})$, $(-\\frac{1}{4}, 2)$, and $(2, \\infty)$.\nWe need to test a value from each interval in the inequality $-4x^2 + 7x + 2 < 0$.\n\nInterval 1: $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4})$. Let's choose $x = -1$.\n\\[-4(-1)^2 + 7(-1) + 2 = -4(1) - 7 + 2 = -4 - 7 + 2 = -9\\]\nSince $-9 < 0$, the inequality is satisfied in the interval $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4})$.\n\nInterval 2: $(-\\frac{1}{4}, 2)$. Let's choose $x = 0$.\n\\[-4(0)^2 + 7(0) + 2 = -4(0) + 0 + 2 = 2\\]\nSince $2 \\not< 0$, the inequality is not satisfied in the interval $(-\\frac{1}{4}, 2)$.\n\nInterval 3: $(2, \\infty)$. Let's choose $x = 3$.\n\\[-4(3)^2 + 7(3) + 2 = -4(9) + 21 + 2 = -36 + 21 + 2 = -13\\]\nSince $-13 < 0$, the inequality is satisfied in the interval $(2, \\infty)$.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the intervals.**\nThe inequality $-4x^2 + 7x + 2 < 0$ is satisfied for $x \\in (-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4})$ and $x \\in (2, \\infty)$.\nTherefore, the solution set is the union of these two intervals.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\n\nThe solution to the inequality $-4x^2 + 7x + 2 < 0$ is the union of the intervals $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4})$ and $(2, \\infty)$. In interval notation, this is written as\n\\[ (-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}) \\cup (2, \\infty). \\]\nWe can verify our answer by considering the parabola $y = -4x^2 + 7x + 2$. Since the leading coefficient is negative, the parabola opens downwards. The roots are $x = -\\frac{1}{4}$ and $x = 2$. The parabola is below the x-axis (i.e., $y < 0$) for $x$ values outside the roots. Thus, the solution is indeed $x < -\\frac{1}{4}$ or $x > 2$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{x \\in (-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{4}) \\cup (2, \\infty)}$",
