    "solution": "## 1. Problem Statement\nWe are given a sequence of non-negative integers defined by the recurrence relation $a_{n+2} = |a_{n+1} - a_n|$ for $n \\geq 1$. We are given the first term $a_1 = 999$ and the condition that $a_2 < 999$. We are also given that $a_{2006} = 1$. We need to determine the number of different possible values for $a_2$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Recurrence relation: $a_{n+2} = |a_{n+1} - a_n|$\n- First term: $a_1 = 999$\n- Constraint on second term: $a_2 < 999$\n- Condition on 2006th term: $a_{2006} = 1$\n- Non-negative integers: $a_n \\geq 0$ for all $n$\n\n## 2. Solution Strategy\nWe know that $\\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1})$ is constant for all $n \\geq 1$. Let $g = \\gcd(a_1, a_2)$. Then $g = \\gcd(a_{2005}, a_{2006}) = \\gcd(a_{2005}, 1) = 1$. Thus, $\\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$.\nWe have $999 = 3^3 \\times 37$. So, we need $a_2$ to be not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 37.\nAlso, we examine the sequence modulo 2. We have $a_{n+2} \\equiv |a_{n+1} - a_n| \\equiv a_{n+1} - a_n \\pmod{2} \\equiv a_{n+1} + a_n \\pmod{2}$.\nThe sequence modulo 2 is determined by $a_1 \\pmod{2}$ and $a_2 \\pmod{2}$.\nSince $a_1 = 999$ is odd, $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nIf $a_{2006} = 1$ is odd, then $a_{2006} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nWe observe that $a_{n+3} \\equiv a_{n+2} + a_{n+1} \\equiv (a_{n+1} + a_n) + a_{n+1} \\equiv a_n \\pmod{2}$. So the sequence modulo 2 is periodic with period 3.\n$a_{2006} \\equiv a_{2006 \\pmod{3}} = a_2 \\pmod{2}$. Since $a_{2006} = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, we must have $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. So $a_2$ must be odd.\nWe need to count the number of odd integers $a_2$ such that $0 \\leq a_2 < 999$, $\\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$.\nThis means $a_2$ is odd, not divisible by 3, and not divisible by 37.\n\nWe count the number of odd integers $a_2$ in the range $0 \\leq a_2 \\leq 998$ (since $a_2 < 999$) that satisfy these conditions.\nTotal number of odd integers in $0 \\leq a_2 \\leq 998$ is 499.\nNumber of odd multiples of 3: $3, 9, 15, \\ldots, 993$. These are of the form $3(2k+1)$. We want $3(2k+1) \\leq 998$, $2k+1 \\leq 332.66$, $2k \\leq 331.66$, $k \\leq 165.83$. So $0 \\leq k \\leq 165$. Number is $166$.\nNumber of odd multiples of 37: $37, 3 \\times 37, 5 \\times 37, \\ldots, 25 \\times 37 = 925$. These are of the form $37(2k+1)$. We want $37(2k+1) \\leq 998$, $2k+1 \\leq 27$, $2k \\leq 26$, $k \\leq 13$. So $0 \\leq k \\leq 13$. Number is $14$.\nNumber of odd multiples of $3 \\times 37 = 111$: $111, 3 \\times 111, 5 \\times 111, 7 \\times 111 = 777, 9 \\times 111 = 999 > 998$. $111, 333, 555, 777$. These are of the form $111(2k+1)$. We want $111(2k+1) \\leq 998$, $2k+1 \\leq 9$, $2k \\leq 8$, $k \\leq 4$. So $0 \\leq k \\leq 4$. Number is $5$.\n\nBy inclusion-exclusion principle, number of odd integers divisible by 3 or 37 is $166 + 14 - 5 = 175$.\nNumber of odd integers not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 37 is $499 - 175 = 324$.\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Condition on GCD:** We know that $\\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1})$ is constant. Since $a_{2006}=1$, we have $\\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \\gcd(a_{2005}, a_{2006}) = \\gcd(a_{2005}, 1) = 1$. Thus $\\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$.\n2. **Prime factorization of 999:** $999 = 3^3 \\times 37$. So $a_2$ must not be divisible by 3 and not divisible by 37.\n3. **Condition modulo 2:** The sequence modulo 2 satisfies $a_{n+2} \\equiv a_{n+1} + a_n \\pmod{2}$ and is periodic with period 3. We have $a_{2006} \\equiv a_{2006 \\pmod{3}} \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{2}$. Since $a_{2006} = 1$, we have $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. So $a_2$ must be odd.\n4. **Counting possible values of $a_2$:** We need to count odd integers $a_2$ such that $0 \\leq a_2 < 999$ and $\\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$. This means $a_2$ is odd, not divisible by 3, and not divisible by 37.\n5. **Number of odd integers less than 999:** In the range $0 \\leq a_2 \\leq 998$, there are 499 odd integers.\n6. **Number of odd multiples of 3 less than 999:** We found there are 166.\n7. **Number of odd multiples of 37 less than 999:** We found there are 14.\n8. **Number of odd multiples of 111 less than 999:** We found there are 5.\n9. **Inclusion-Exclusion:** Number of odd integers divisible by 3 or 37 is $166 + 14 - 5 = 175$.\n10. **Number of valid $a_2$ values:** Number of odd integers not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 37 is $499 - 175 = 324$.\n\n## 4.
