    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n\nLet a sequence $\\{b_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ be defined by the recurrence relation $b_{n+1} = b_n b_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 2$, with initial conditions $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 2$. The problem is to calculate the value of the 20th term of this sequence, $b_{20}$.\n\n- **Sequence:** $\\{b_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$\n- **Recurrence Relation:** $b_{n+1} = b_n b_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 2$\n- **Initial Conditions:** $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 2$\n- **Target:** Calculate $b_{20}$\n\n## Solution Strategy\n\nWe will first compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify a pattern.  We observe that the terms can be expressed as powers of 2. We will then find a recurrence relation for the exponents of 2 in the terms of the sequence. This recurrence relation turns out to be related to the Fibonacci sequence.  We will then find the exponent for $b_{20}$ and hence $b_{20}$ itself.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Recurrence relation of the sequence: $b_{n+1} = b_n b_{n-1}$\n- Properties of exponents: $a^m a^n = a^{m+n}$\n- Fibonacci sequence recurrence: $F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}$\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the first few terms of the sequence:**\n   - $b_1 = 1$\n   - $b_2 = 2$\n   - $b_3 = b_2 b_1 = 2 \\times 1 = 2$\n   - $b_4 = b_3 b_2 = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n   - $b_5 = b_4 b_3 = 4 \\times 2 = 8$\n   - $b_6 = b_5 b_4 = 8 \\times 4 = 32$\n   - $b_7 = b_6 b_5 = 32 \\times 8 = 256$\n   - $b_8 = b_7 b_6 = 256 \\times 32 = 8192$\n\n2. **Express the terms as powers of 2:**\n   - $b_1 = 1 = 2^0$\n   - $b_2 = 2 = 2^1$\n   - $b_3 = 2 = 2^1$\n   - $b_4 = 4 = 2^2$\n   - $b_5 = 8 = 2^3$\n   - $b_6 = 32 = 2^5$\n   - $b_7 = 256 = 2^8$\n   - $b_8 = 8192 = 2^{13}$\n\n3. **Let $b_n = 2^{e_n}$. Find the recurrence relation for $e_n$:**\n   Substitute $b_n = 2^{e_n}$ into $b_{n+1} = b_n b_{n-1}$:\n   $2^{e_{n+1}} = 2^{e_n} \\times 2^{e_{n-1}} = 2^{e_n + e_{n-1}}$\n   Equating the exponents, we get $e_{n+1} = e_n + e_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n   The initial conditions for $e_n$ are:\n   - $e_1$ such that $b_1 = 2^{e_1} = 1 \\implies e_1 = 0$\n   - $e_2$ such that $b_2 = 2^{e_2} = 2 \\implies e_2 = 1$\n\n4. **Recognize $e_n$ as a shifted Fibonacci sequence:**\n   The sequence $e_n$ is defined by $e_1 = 0$, $e_2 = 1$, and $e_{n+1} = e_n + e_{n-1}$, which is the Fibonacci sequence with a shift in index.  Let $F_n$ be the standard Fibonacci sequence with $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, \\ldots$. We observe that $e_n = F_{n-1}$. We need to find $e_{20}$, which is $F_{19}$.\n\n5. **Calculate $F_{19}$:**\n   We can calculate Fibonacci numbers iteratively starting from $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$:\n   $F_0 = 0$\n   $F_1 = 1$\n   $F_2 = 1$\n   $F_3 = 2$\n   $F_4 = 3$\n   $F_5 = 5$\n   $F_6 = 8$\n   $F_7 = 13$\n   $F_8 = 21$\n   $F_9 = 34$\n   $F_{10} = 55$\n   $F_{11} = 89$\n   $F_{12} = 144$\n   $F_{13} = 233$\n   $F_{14} = 377$\n   $F_{15} = 610$\n   $F_{16} = 987$\n   $F_{17} = 1597$\n   $F_{18} = 2584$\n   $F_{19} = 4181$\n\n6. **Calculate $b_{20}$:**\n   Since $e_{20} = F_{19} = 4181$, we have $b_{20} = 2^{e_{20}} = 2^{4181}$.\n\n## Final Answer\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2^{4181}}$",
