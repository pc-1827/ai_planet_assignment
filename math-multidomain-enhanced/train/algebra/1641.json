    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nDetermine the value of the sum $S = -1 + 2 + 3 + 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 + \\dots + 10000$, where the signs of the terms change after each perfect square.\nThe series starts with -1. The sign changes after $1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9, 4^2=16$, and so on, up to $100^2=10000$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- The series sums integers from 1 to 10000.\n- The sign of the terms changes after each perfect square.\n- The first term (1) has a negative sign.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will group the terms in blocks, where each block is between consecutive perfect squares.\nThe $n$-th block (starting from $n=0$) will range from $(n)^2+1$ to $(n+1)^2$. The sign of the terms in the $n$-th block is given by $(-1)^{n+1}$.\nWe will calculate the sum of terms in each block and then sum up the block sums.\nWe will identify a pattern for the sum of the first $m$ blocks and use it to find the sum up to $100^2 = 10000$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nLet's write down the blocks and their signs:\nBlock 0: from $1$ to $1^2=1$. Sign: $(-1)^{0+1} = -1$. Terms: $-1$. Sum: $-1$.\nBlock 1: from $1^2+1=2$ to $2^2=4$. Sign: $(-1)^{1+1} = +1$. Terms: $2, 3, 4$. Sum: $2+3+4 = 9$.\nBlock 2: from $2^2+1=5$ to $3^2=9$. Sign: $(-1)^{2+1} = -1$. Terms: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$. Sum: $-(5+6+7+8+9) = -35$.\nBlock 3: from $3^2+1=10$ to $4^2=16$. Sign: $(-1)^{3+1} = +1$. Terms: $10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16$. Sum: $10+11+12+13+14+15+16 = 91$.\nBlock $n$: from $n^2+1$ to $(n+1)^2$. Sign: $(-1)^{n+1}$. Sum of integers from $a$ to $b$ is $\\frac{(a+b)(b-a+1)}{2}$.\nSum of terms in block $n$ is $(-1)^{n+1} \\sum_{k=n^2+1}^{(n+1)^2} k = (-1)^{n+1} \\frac{(n^2+1 + (n+1)^2)((n+1)^2 - (n^2+1) + 1)}{2} = (-1)^{n+1} (2n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1)$.\n\nWe need to sum the block sums for $n=0$ to $n=99$ (since the last perfect square is $100^2 = 10000$).\nLet $S_m = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} (-1)^{n+1} (2n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1)$. We want to find $S_{100}$.\nWe can show by induction that $S_m = (-1)^m m^3$.\nBase case: $m=1$, $S_1 = (-1)^{0+1} (2(0)^3 + 3(0)^2 + 3(0) + 1) = -1 = (-1)^1 1^3$.\nInductive step: Assume $S_k = (-1)^k k^3$. We want to show $S_{k+1} = (-1)^{k+1} (k+1)^3$.\n$S_{k+1} = S_k + (-1)^{(k)+1} (2k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1) = (-1)^k k^3 + (-1)^{k+1} (2k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1) = (-1)^{k+1} [-k^3 + (2k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1)] = (-1)^{k+1} (k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1) = (-1)^{k+1} (k+1)^3$.\nThus, by induction, $S_m = (-1)^m m^3$.\nFor $m=100$, $S_{100} = (-1)^{100} (100)^3 = 1 \\times 1000000 = 1000000$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1000000}$",
