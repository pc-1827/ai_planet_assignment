    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nRewrite the problem in clear terms and highlight key variables and constraints.\n\nThe graph of a function $y = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ is given, where $p(x)$ is a linear function and $q(x)$ is a quadratic function. We are asked to find the value of $\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)}$. From the graph, we can observe the locations of vertical asymptotes and infer the form of $q(x)$. We can also observe points on the graph to determine the coefficients in $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $y = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$\n- $p(x)$ is a linear function.\n- $q(x)$ is a quadratic function.\n- We need to find $\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)}$.\n- The graph provides visual information about the function.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nExplain your approach and list relevant formulas/theorems.\n\nOur strategy is to determine the expressions for $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ from the given graph.\n1. **Identify vertical asymptotes:** Vertical asymptotes occur where $q(x) = 0$. From the graph, we can find the roots of $q(x)$.\n2. **Identify horizontal asymptote:** The horizontal asymptote gives information about the degrees of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ and the ratio of leading coefficients.\n3. **Find zeros of the function:** Zeros occur where $p(x) = 0$. From the graph, we can find the roots of $p(x)$.\n4. **Use a point on the graph to find the leading coefficient(s) or a constant factor.**\n5. **Evaluate $\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)}$.**\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- Vertical asymptotes of a rational function $y = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ occur at the real roots of $q(x) = 0$, provided that these roots are not also roots of $p(x) = 0$.\n- Horizontal asymptote of a rational function $y = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$:\n    - If degree of $p(x) <$ degree of $q(x)$, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.\n- A linear function has the form $p(x) = bx + c$.\n- A quadratic function has the form $q(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nShow each mathematical step, explain your reasoning, and include intermediate calculations.\n\n1. **Identify vertical asymptotes:**\n   From the graph, the vertical asymptotes are at $x = -3$ and $x = 2$. These are indicated by dashed vertical lines. Therefore, $q(x) = 0$ when $x = -3$ or $x = 2$. Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, we can write $q(x) = a(x - 2)(x + 3)$ for some constant $a \\neq 0$.\n\n2. **Identify horizontal asymptote:**\n   From the graph, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$. This is because as $x$ goes to $\\pm \\infty$, the graph approaches the x-axis. This is consistent with the degree of $p(x)$ (linear, degree 1) being less than the degree of $q(x)$ (quadratic, degree 2).\n\n3. **Find zeros of the function:**\n   The graph passes through the origin $(0, 0)$. This means when $x = 0$, $y = 0$. So, $\\frac{p(0)}{q(0)} = 0$. Since $q(0) = a(0-2)(0+3) = -6a \\neq 0$ (as $a \\neq 0$), we must have $p(0) = 0$. Since $p(x)$ is linear, and $p(0) = 0$, we can write $p(x) = bx$ for some constant $b \\neq 0$ (if $b=0$, then $p(x)=0$, which is not generally linear and would make the function identically zero except at asymptotes).\n\n4. **Determine the constant factor:**\n   So we have $y = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \\frac{bx}{a(x-2)(x+3)} = \\frac{B x}{(x-2)(x+3)}$, where $B = \\frac{b}{a}$.\n   We need to find the value of $B$. Let's use a point from the graph. We can observe from the graph that when $x = 1$, $y = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n   Plug in $x = 1$ and $y = -\\frac{1}{2}$ into the equation:\n   $-\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{B(1)}{(1-2)(1+3)} = \\frac{B}{(-1)(4)} = -\\frac{B}{4}$.\n   Multiply both sides by $-4$:\n   $(-4) \\times (-\\frac{1}{2}) = (-4) \\times (-\\frac{B}{4})$\n   $2 = B$.\n   So, $B = 2$. Thus, $y = \\frac{2x}{(x-2)(x+3)}$. We have $p(x) = 2x$ and $q(x) = (x-2)(x+3)$.\n\n5. **Evaluate $\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)}$:**\n   We have $p(x) = 2x$ and $q(x) = (x-2)(x+3)$.\n   $p(-1) = 2(-1) = -2$.\n   $q(-1) = (-1-2)(-1+3) = (-3)(2) = -6$.\n   $\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)} = \\frac{-2}{-6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nPresent result in  \\boxed{answer} format and verify the answer satisfies all conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$\n\nVerification:\n- $p(x) = 2x$ is linear.\n- $q(x) = (x-2)(x+3) = x^2 + x - 6$ is quadratic.\n- Vertical asymptotes at $x = 2$ and $x = -3$ because $q(2) = 0$ and $q(-3) = 0$.\n- Horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$ because the degree of $p(x)$ is less than the degree of $q(x)$.\n- The graph passes through $(0, 0)$ because $p(0) = 0$.\n- At $x = 1$, $y = \\frac{2(1)}{(1-2)(1+3)} = \\frac{2}{(-1)(4)} = -\\frac{1}{2}$, which is consistent with the graph.\n- $\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)} = \\frac{2(-1)}{(-1-2)(-1+3)} = \\frac{-2}{(-3)(2)} = \\frac{-2}{-6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe answer is consistent with all the given conditions and observations from the graph.",
