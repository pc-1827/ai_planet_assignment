    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nThe problem states that the rational function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1}{q(x)}$ has a horizontal asymptote. We need to determine the smallest possible degree of the polynomial $q(x)$.\nLet $P(x) = 2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1$. The degree of $P(x)$ is $\\text{deg}(P) = 6$. Let the degree of $q(x)$ be $\\text{deg}(q) = m$.\n\n### Solution Strategy\nA rational function $\\frac{P(x)}{q(x)}$ has a horizontal asymptote if the degree of the numerator $P(x)$ is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator $q(x)$.\nLet $n = \\text{deg}(P)$ and $m = \\text{deg}(q)$.\n- If $n < m$, the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$.\n- If $n = m$, the horizontal asymptote is $y = \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\\text{leading coefficient of } q(x)}$.\n- If $n > m$, there is no horizontal asymptote.\n\nIn our case, $n = \\text{deg}(P) = 6$. For the rational function to have a horizontal asymptote, we must have $m \\ge n$, i.e., $m \\ge 6$.\nWe are looking for the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$, which is the smallest possible value of $m$.\nThe smallest integer $m$ that satisfies $m \\ge 6$ is $m = 6$.\n\nThus, the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ is 6.\n\nLet's consider an example to verify.\nIf $\\text{deg}(q) = 6$, let $q(x) = x^6$. Then $f(x) = \\frac{2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1}{x^6}$.\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) = \\frac{2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1}{x^6} = \\frac{x^6(2 + 3/x - 1/x^4 - 1/x^6)}{x^6} = 2 + \\frac{3}{x} - \\frac{1}{x^4} - \\frac{1}{x^6} \\to 2$.\nSimilarly, as $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to 2$.\nSo, $y = 2$ is a horizontal asymptote when $\\text{deg}(q) = 6$.\n\nIf $\\text{deg}(q) < 6$, for instance $\\text{deg}(q) = 5$, let $q(x) = x^5$. Then $f(x) = \\frac{2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1}{x^5}$.\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) = \\frac{2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1}{x^5} = \\frac{x^6(2 + 3/x - 1/x^4 - 1/x^6)}{x^5} = x(2 + \\frac{3}{x} - \\frac{1}{x^4} - \\frac{1}{x^6}) = 2x + 3 - \\frac{1}{x^3} - \\frac{1}{x^5}$.\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to \\infty$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to -\\infty$.\nIn this case, there is no horizontal asymptote.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ for the rational function to have a horizontal asymptote is 6.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Identify the degree of the numerator:**\n   The numerator is $P(x) = 2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1$. The degree of the numerator is $n = 6$.\n\n2. **Conditions for horizontal asymptote:**\n   For a rational function $\\frac{P(x)}{q(x)}$ to have a horizontal asymptote, the degree of the denominator $m = \\text{deg}(q(x))$ must be greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator $n$. That is, $m \\ge n$.\n\n3. **Apply the condition to the problem:**\n   In our case, $n = 6$. So, we must have $m \\ge 6$ for the rational function to have a horizontal asymptote.\n\n4. **Find the smallest possible degree:**\n   We want to find the smallest possible value for $m$. Since $m$ must be an integer and $m \\ge 6$, the smallest possible value for $m$ is 6.\n\n5. **Verify for the smallest degree:**\n   If the degree of $q(x)$ is 6, say $q(x) = x^6$, the rational function becomes $f(x) = \\frac{2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1}{x^6}$.\n   The horizontal asymptote is given by the ratio of the leading coefficients, which is $y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$. So, there is a horizontal asymptote when the degree of $q(x)$ is 6.\n\n6. **Verify for a degree smaller than the smallest degree:**\n   If the degree of $q(x)$ is less than 6, say 5, then the degree of the numerator (6) is greater than the degree of the denominator (5). In this case, there is no horizontal asymptote.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   The smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ for the rational function to have a horizontal asymptote is 6.\n\n### Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",
