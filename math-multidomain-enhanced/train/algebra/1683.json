    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nFind the sum of the x-coordinates of all ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of complex numbers that satisfy the system of equations:\n\\begin{align*} x + yz &= 7 \\quad &(1)\\\\ y + xz &= 10 \\quad &(2)\\\\ z + xy &= 10 \\quad &(3) \\end{align*}\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Subtract equation (3) from equation (2):**\nSubtracting equation (3) from equation (2) gives:\n$(y + xz) - (z + xy) = 10 - 10$\n$y + xz - z - xy = 0$\nRearranging terms, we get:\n$(y - z) + (xz - xy) = 0$\nFactor out common terms:\n$(y - z) - x(y - z) = 0$\nFactor out $(y - z)$:\n$(y - z)(1 - x) = 0$\n\n2. **Consider two cases based on the factored equation:**\n\n   **Case 1:** $y - z = 0$, which means $y = z$.\n   Substitute $y = z$ into the original system of equations:\n   Equation (1) becomes $x + y^2 = 7$.\n   Equation (2) becomes $y + xy = 10$.\n   Equation (3) becomes $y + xy = 10$, which is the same as equation (2).\n   From the equation $y + xy = 10$, we can factor out $y$ to get $y(1 + x) = 10$. If $x \\neq -1$, then $y = \\frac{10}{1 + x}$.\n   Substitute $y = \\frac{10}{1 + x}$ into $x + y^2 = 7$:\n   $x + \\left(\\frac{10}{1 + x}\\right)^2 = 7$\n   $x + \\frac{100}{(1 + x)^2} = 7$\n   Multiply both sides by $(1 + x)^2$ to clear the denominator (assuming $x \\neq -1$):\n   $x(1 + x)^2 + 100 = 7(1 + x)^2$\n   $x(1 + 2x + x^2) + 100 = 7(1 + 2x + x^2)$\n   $x + 2x^2 + x^3 + 100 = 7 + 14x + 7x^2$\n   Rearrange the terms to form a cubic equation in $x$:\n   $x^3 + (2 - 7)x^2 + (1 - 14)x + (100 - 7) = 0$\n   $x^3 - 5x^2 - 13x + 93 = 0$\n   Let the roots of this cubic equation be $x_1, x_2, x_3$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -(\\frac{-5}{1}) = 5$.\n   If $x=-1$, then $y(1+x)=10$ becomes $y(0)=10$, which is impossible. So $x \\neq -1$.\n\n   **Case 2:** $1 - x = 0$, which means $x = 1$.\n   Substitute $x = 1$ into the original system of equations:\n   Equation (1) becomes $1 + yz = 7 \\implies yz = 6$.\n   Equation (2) becomes $y + 1 \\cdot z = 10 \\implies y + z = 10$.\n   Equation (3) becomes $z + 1 \\cdot y = 10 \\implies z + y = 10$, which is the same as equation (2).\n   We have the system:\n   $y + z = 10$\n   $yz = 6$\n   From $y + z = 10$, we have $z = 10 - y$. Substitute this into $yz = 6$:\n   $y(10 - y) = 6$\n   $10y - y^2 = 6$\n   $y^2 - 10y + 6 = 0$\n   This is a quadratic equation in $y$. Let $y_4, y_5$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. For each root of $y$, we have $x = 1$. Thus, we have two solutions for $x$ in this case, both equal to $1$. The sum of these x-values is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n3. **Sum of all possible x-values:**\n   The sum of the x-values from Case 1 is $5$.\n   The sum of the x-values from Case 2 is $2$.\n   The total sum of all possible x-values is $5 + 2 = 7$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{7}$",
