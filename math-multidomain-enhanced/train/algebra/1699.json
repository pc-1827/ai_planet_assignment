    "solution": "### Problem:\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   - Determine the type of conic section represented by the equation $|y+5| = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2}$.\n   - Key variables: x, y\n   - Constraint: The equation must be satisfied.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   - Eliminate the square root and absolute value by squaring both sides of the equation.\n   - Simplify the resulting equation to identify the standard form of a conic section.\n   - Compare the simplified equation with the standard forms of circle, parabola, ellipse, and hyperbola.\n   - Determine the type of conic section.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - **Step 1: Square both sides of the equation.**\n     Squaring both sides of $|y+5| = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2}$ yields:\n     \\[ (|y+5|)^2 = (\\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2})^2 \\]\n     \\[ (y+5)^2 = (x-2)^2 + y^2 \\]\n\n   - **Step 2: Expand the squared terms.**\n     Expanding both sides of the equation:\n     \\[ y^2 + 2 \\cdot y \\cdot 5 + 5^2 = (x^2 - 2 \\cdot x \\cdot 2 + 2^2) + y^2 \\]\n     \\[ y^2 + 10y + 25 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 \\]\n\n   - **Step 3: Simplify the equation.**\n     Subtract $y^2$ from both sides:\n     \\[ 10y + 25 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \\]\n     Isolate $y$ terms on one side and $x$ terms on the other side:\n     \\[ 10y = x^2 - 4x + 4 - 25 \\]\n     \\[ 10y = x^2 - 4x - 21 \\]\n\n   - **Step 4: Express $y$ in terms of $x$.**\n     Divide both sides by 10 to solve for $y$:\n     \\[ y = \\frac{1}{10} (x^2 - 4x - 21) \\]\n     \\[ y = \\frac{1}{10}x^2 - \\frac{4}{10}x - \\frac{21}{10} \\]\n     \\[ y = \\frac{1}{10}x^2 - \\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{21}{10} \\]\n\n   - **Step 5: Identify the conic section.**\n     The equation is in the form $y = Ax^2 + Bx + C$, where $A = \\frac{1}{10}$, $B = -\\frac{2}{5}$, and $C = -\\frac{21}{10}$.\n     This is the standard form of a parabola that opens upwards (since $A = \\frac{1}{10} > 0$).\n     The general form of a parabola is given by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ where either $A=0$ or $C=0$ but not both, and $B^2 - 4AC = B^2 \\ne 0$. In our case, we can rewrite the equation as:\n     $10y = x^2 - 4x - 21$\n     $x^2 - 4x - 10y - 21 = 0$\n     Here, $A=1$, $B=0$, $C=0$, $D=-4$, $E=-10$, $F=-21$. Since $C=0$ and $A \\ne 0$, and $B^2 - 4AC = 0^2 - 4(1)(0) = 0$, this is indeed a parabola.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   - The conic section described by the equation is a parabola.\n   - Final Answer: \\boxed{P}",
