    "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\nFind the sum of all real solutions to the equation \\[\\frac{x-2}{x^2+4x+1} = \\frac{x-5}{x^2-10x}.\\]\nWe need to find all real values of $x$ that satisfy this equation, and then sum them up.\nThe variables are $x$, and the equation is a rational equation. We need to consider the constraints on $x$ such that the denominators are not zero.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\n1. Determine the domain of the equation by finding the values of $x$ for which the denominators are zero, and exclude these values from possible solutions.\n2. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions and obtain a polynomial equation.\n3. Solve the polynomial equation.\n4. Check if the solutions are within the domain.\n5. Calculate the sum of the valid real solutions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Determine the domain:**\n   The denominators are $x^2+4x+1$ and $x^2-10x = x(x-10)$.\n   We need to find the values of $x$ for which $x^2+4x+1 = 0$ or $x^2-10x = 0$.\n   For $x^2-10x = 0$, we have $x(x-10) = 0$, so $x=0$ or $x=10$.\n   For $x^2+4x+1 = 0$, using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, we have $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n   So, the values of $x$ that must be excluded from the domain are $x = 0, 10, -2+\\sqrt{3}, -2-\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n2. **Cross-multiply and simplify:**\n   Multiply both sides by $(x^2+4x+1)(x^2-10x)$ to eliminate denominators:\n   $(x-2)(x^2-10x) = (x-5)(x^2+4x+1)$\n   Expand both sides:\n   $x(x^2-10x) - 2(x^2-10x) = x(x^2+4x+1) - 5(x^2+4x+1)$\n   $x^3 - 10x^2 - 2x^2 + 20x = x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 5x^2 - 20x - 5$\n   $x^3 - 12x^2 + 20x = x^3 - x^2 - 19x - 5$\n   Subtract $x^3$ from both sides:\n   $-12x^2 + 20x = -x^2 - 19x - 5$\n   Move all terms to one side to get a quadratic equation:\n   $-12x^2 + x^2 + 20x + 19x + 5 = 0$\n   $-11x^2 + 39x + 5 = 0$\n   Multiply by $-1$ to make the leading coefficient positive:\n   $11x^2 - 39x - 5 = 0$\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation:**\n   For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is given by $-b/a$.\n   In our equation $11x^2 - 39x - 5 = 0$, we have $a = 11$, $b = -39$, $c = -5$.\n   The sum of the roots is $-\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{-39}{11} = \\frac{39}{11}$.\n\n4. **Check if solutions are in the domain:**\n   The sum of the roots is $\\frac{39}{11}$. We need to check if the individual roots are in the domain, but for the sum, we only need to make sure that the roots are real and distinct and not excluded from the domain. For a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ to have real roots, the discriminant $D = b^2-4ac$ must be non-negative. In our case, $D = (-39)^2 - 4(11)(-5) = 1521 + 220 = 1741 > 0$. So, there are two distinct real roots.\n   Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots. Then $x_1+x_2 = \\frac{39}{11}$. We need to check if $x_1, x_2$ are among the excluded values $0, 10, -2+\\sqrt{3}, -2-\\sqrt{3}$.\n   Since the sum of the roots is $\\frac{39}{11} \\approx 3.54$, it is unlikely that the roots themselves are these specific values.\n   We know that the sum of the roots is $\\frac{39}{11}$. We don't need to find the individual roots to find their sum. As long as the roots are real and within the domain, the sum is valid. Since the discriminant is positive, the roots are real and distinct. We already excluded the values that make the denominators zero. Assuming the roots are not equal to the excluded values, the sum of the real solutions is $\\frac{39}{11}$.\n\n5. **Calculate the sum of valid real solutions:**\n   The sum of the real solutions is $\\frac{39}{11}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{39}{11}}$",
