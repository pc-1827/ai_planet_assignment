    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven a function $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ defined as:\n\\[f(n) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nn + 3 & \\text{if $n$ is odd}, \\\\\nn/2 & \\text{if $n$ is even}.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]\nWe are given that $k$ is an odd integer and $f(f(f(k))) = 27$. We need to find the value of $k.$\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Function $f(n)$ is piecewise defined based on parity of $n$.\n- $k$ is an odd integer.\n- $f(f(f(k))) = 27$.\n- We need to find the value of $k$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will apply the function $f$ three times to $k$, starting from the outermost application. Since $k$ is odd, we first use the rule for odd numbers for $f(k)$. Then we determine the parity of $f(k)$ and use the corresponding rule to find $f(f(k))$, and so on. We will consider cases based on the parity of intermediate values to evaluate $f(f(f(k)))$ and set it equal to 27 to solve for $k$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nSince $k$ is odd, we apply the first rule of the function:\nStep 1: Calculate $f(k)$.\n\\[f(k) = k + 3\\]\nSince $k$ is odd, $k+3$ is even.\n\nStep 2: Calculate $f(f(k)) = f(k+3)$.\nSince $k+3$ is even, we apply the second rule of the function:\n\\[f(f(k)) = f(k+3) = \\frac{k+3}{2}\\]\n\nStep 3: Calculate $f(f(f(k))) = f\\left(\\frac{k+3}{2}\\right)$.\nNow we need to consider two cases based on the parity of $\\frac{k+3}{2}$.\n\nCase 1: $\\frac{k+3}{2}$ is odd.\nIn this case, we use the first rule of the function:\n\\[f\\left(\\frac{k+3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{k+3}{2} + 3\\]\nWe are given that $f(f(f(k))) = 27$, so we have:\n\\[\\frac{k+3}{2} + 3 = 27\\]\n\\[\\frac{k+3}{2} = 27 - 3 = 24\\]\n\\[k+3 = 24 \\times 2 = 48\\]\n\\[k = 48 - 3 = 45\\]\nNow we need to check if our assumption that $\\frac{k+3}{2}$ is odd holds for $k=45$.\nIf $k=45$, then $\\frac{k+3}{2} = \\frac{45+3}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24$.\nBut 24 is even, not odd. So, our assumption that $\\frac{k+3}{2}$ is odd is false in this case. Therefore, Case 1 does not yield a valid solution.\n\nCase 2: $\\frac{k+3}{2}$ is even.\nIn this case, we use the second rule of the function:\n\\[f\\left(\\frac{k+3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(k+3)/2}{2} = \\frac{k+3}{4}\\]\nWe are given that $f(f(f(k))) = 27$, so we have:\n\\[\\frac{k+3}{4} = 27\\]\n\\[k+3 = 27 \\times 4 = 108\\]\n\\[k = 108 - 3 = 105\\]\nNow we need to check if our assumption that $\\frac{k+3}{2}$ is even holds for $k=105$.\nIf $k=105$, then $\\frac{k+3}{2} = \\frac{105+3}{2} = \\frac{108}{2} = 54$.\n54 is even. So, our assumption that $\\frac{k+3}{2}$ is even is true in this case.\nAlso, $k=105$ is odd, which is given in the problem statement.\n\nLet's verify $f(f(f(105)))$:\n$f(105) = 105 + 3 = 108$ (since 105 is odd)\n$f(108) = 108 / 2 = 54$ (since 108 is even)\n$f(54) = 54 / 2 = 27$ (since 54 is even)\nSo, $f(f(f(105))) = 27$, which matches the given condition.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{105}$",
