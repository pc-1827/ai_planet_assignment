    "solution": "**Problem Statement**\nFind the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation involving absolute values:\n\\[|x-20| + |x-18| = |2x-36|.\\]\nHere, the variable is $x,$ and we need to find its value that makes the equation true.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\nWe will solve this equation by considering different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute value signs become zero. The critical points are $x=18$ and $x=20.$ These points divide the real number line into three intervals: $x < 18,$ $18 \\leq x \\leq 20,$ and $x > 20.$ We will analyze the equation in each interval by removing the absolute value signs based on the sign of the expressions inside them.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nCase 1: $x < 18$\nIn this case, $x-20 < 0,$ $x-18 < 0,$ and $2x-36 < 0.$ Therefore,\n$|x-20| = -(x-20) = 20-x,$\n$|x-18| = -(x-18) = 18-x,$\n$|2x-36| = -(2x-36) = 36-2x.$\nSubstituting these into the equation, we get:\n$(20-x) + (18-x) = (36-2x)$\n$38 - 2x = 36 - 2x$\n$38 = 36$\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution in the interval $x < 18.$\n\nCase 2: $18 \\leq x \\leq 20$\nIn this case, $x-20 \\leq 0,$ $x-18 \\geq 0,$ and $2x-36 \\geq 0.$ Therefore,\n$|x-20| = -(x-20) = 20-x,$\n$|x-18| = (x-18) = x-18,$\n$|2x-36| = (2x-36) = 2x-36.$\nSubstituting these into the equation, we get:\n$(20-x) + (x-18) = (2x-36)$\n$20 - x + x - 18 = 2x - 36$\n$2 = 2x - 36$\n$2 + 36 = 2x$\n$38 = 2x$\n$x = \\frac{38}{2} = 19$\nSince $18 \\leq 19 \\leq 20,$ $x=19$ is a valid solution in this interval.\n\nCase 3: $x > 20$\nIn this case, $x-20 > 0,$ $x-18 > 0,$ and $2x-36 > 0.$ Therefore,\n$|x-20| = (x-20) = x-20,$\n$|x-18| = (x-18) = x-18,$\n$|2x-36| = (2x-36) = 2x-36.$\nSubstituting these into the equation, we get:\n$(x-20) + (x-18) = (2x-36)$\n$2x - 38 = 2x - 36$\n$-38 = -36$\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution in the interval $x > 20.$\n\nThe only solution is $x=19.$ Let's verify this solution by substituting it back into the original equation:\n$|19-20| + |19-18| = |-1| + |1| = 1 + 1 = 2.$\n$|2(19)-36| = |38-36| = |2| = 2.$\nSince $2 = 2,$ the solution $x=19$ is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{19}$",
