    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nFind the smallest possible degree of a nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients that has all of the numbers $1+\\sqrt{2}, \\; 2+\\sqrt{3}, \\;3+\\sqrt{4},\\; \\dots, \\;1000+\\sqrt{1001}$ as roots.\nLet $r_n = n + \\sqrt{n+1}$ for $n = 1, 2, \\dots, 1000$. We are given that these $r_n$ are roots of a polynomial $P(x)$ with rational coefficients. We want to find the minimum degree of $P(x)$.\n\n### Solution Strategy\nFor a polynomial with rational coefficients, if $a+\\sqrt{b}$ is a root where $a, b$ are rational and $\\sqrt{b}$ is irrational, then its conjugate $a-\\sqrt{b}$ must also be a root.\nWe need to check for each $n$ from 1 to 1000 whether $\\sqrt{n+1}$ is rational or irrational.\nIf $\\sqrt{n+1}$ is rational, then $r_n = n + \\sqrt{n+1}$ is rational.\nIf $\\sqrt{n+1}$ is irrational, then for $r_n = n + \\sqrt{n+1}$ to be a root of a polynomial with rational coefficients, its conjugate $n - \\sqrt{n+1}$ must also be a root.\nWe need to count how many values of $n$ from 1 to 1000 make $\\sqrt{n+1}$ rational (i.e., $n+1$ is a perfect square).\nIf $n+1 = k^2$ for some integer $k$, then $\\sqrt{n+1} = k$ is rational. In this case, $r_n = n+k = k^2-1+k$ is a rational root.\nIf $n+1$ is not a perfect square, then $\\sqrt{n+1}$ is irrational, and we must include both $n+\\sqrt{n+1}$ and $n-\\sqrt{n+1}$ as roots.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\nWe need to find the number of integers $n$ in the range $1 \\le n \\le 1000$ such that $n+1$ is a perfect square.\nLet $n+1 = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Then $n = k^2 - 1$.\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 1000$, we have $1 \\le k^2 - 1 \\le 1000$, which means $2 \\le k^2 \\le 1001$.\nTaking the square root, we get $\\sqrt{2} \\le k \\le \\sqrt{1001}$.\nSince $k$ must be an integer, we have $2 \\le k \\le 31$ (because $1^2 = 1 < 2$, $2^2 = 4 \\ge 2$, $31^2 = 961 \\le 1001$, $32^2 = 1024 > 1001$).\nThe number of possible integer values for $k$ is $31 - 2 + 1 = 30$.\nFor these 30 values of $n$, $r_n = n + \\sqrt{n+1}$ is a rational number. For each of these 30 values of $n$, we have one root.\n\nFor the remaining $1000 - 30 = 970$ values of $n$, $n+1$ is not a perfect square, so $\\sqrt{n+1}$ is irrational.\nFor each of these 970 values of $n$, since we want a polynomial with rational coefficients, we must include both $r_n = n + \\sqrt{n+1}$ and its conjugate $n - \\sqrt{n+1}$ as roots.\nThus, for these 970 values of $n$, we have two roots for each $n$.\n\nThe total number of roots needed is the sum of the number of roots from both cases.\nNumber of roots from case 1 (rational roots) = 30.\nNumber of roots from case 2 (irrational roots and their conjugates) = $970 \\times 2 = 1940$.\nTotal number of roots = $30 + 1940 = 1970$.\nSince we want the smallest possible degree of such a polynomial, and we have identified the minimum set of roots required, the smallest possible degree is the total number of roots.\n\nThe minimal polynomial will be the product of linear factors for rational roots and quadratic factors for pairs of conjugate irrational roots.\nFor each $n$ such that $n+1=k^2$, we have a linear factor $(x - (n+k))$.\nFor each $n$ such that $n+1$ is not a perfect square, we have a quadratic factor $(x - (n+\\sqrt{n+1}))(x - (n-\\sqrt{n+1})) = (x-n)^2 - (\\sqrt{n+1})^2 = x^2 - 2nx + n^2 - (n+1) = x^2 - 2nx + n^2 - n - 1$.\nThe degree of the polynomial is the sum of the degrees of these factors, which is $30 \\times 1 + 970 \\times 2 = 1970$.\n\n### Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1970}$",
