    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven two equations involving positive integers $x$ and $y$:\n\\[ xy+x+y=71 \\]\n\\[ x^2y+xy^2 = 880 \\]\nWe are asked to find the value of $x^2+y^2$.\n\nKey variables: $x, y$\nConstraints: $x, y$ are positive integers.\nObjective: Find $x^2+y^2$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use substitution and factorization to simplify the given equations and solve for $x$ and $y$.\nFrom the second equation, we can factor out $xy$.\nThen we can use a substitution based on the first equation to form a quadratic equation.\nSolve the quadratic equation to find the values of the substituted variable.\nBack-substitute to find possible values for $x$ and $y$.\nFinally, calculate $x^2+y^2$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Quadratic formula: For $ax^2+bx+c=0$, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the second equation**\nFactor out $xy$ from the second equation:\n\\[ x^2y+xy^2 = xy(x+y) = 880 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Use substitution**\nLet $u = xy$ and $v = x+y$.\nThe given equations become:\n\\[ u+v = 71 \\quad \\cdots (3) \\]\n\\[ uv = 880 \\quad \\cdots (4) \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for $u$ and $v$**\nFrom equation (3), we have $v = 71-u$. Substitute this into equation (4):\n\\[ u(71-u) = 880 \\]\n\\[ 71u - u^2 = 880 \\]\nRearrange to form a quadratic equation in $u$:\n\\[ u^2 - 71u + 880 = 0 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation**\nUse the quadratic formula to solve for $u$:\n\\[ u = \\frac{-(-71) \\pm \\sqrt{(-71)^2 - 4(1)(880)}}{2(1)} \\]\n\\[ u = \\frac{71 \\pm \\sqrt{5041 - 3520}}{2} \\]\n\\[ u = \\frac{71 \\pm \\sqrt{1521}}{2} \\]\nWe need to find the square root of 1521. We note that $30^2 = 900$ and $40^2 = 1600$, so the square root is between 30 and 40. Trying 39, we get $39^2 = (40-1)^2 = 1600 - 80 + 1 = 1521$. So $\\sqrt{1521} = 39$.\n\\[ u = \\frac{71 \\pm 39}{2} \\]\nWe have two possible values for $u$:\nCase 1: $u = \\frac{71+39}{2} = \\frac{110}{2} = 55$\nCase 2: $u = \\frac{71-39}{2} = \\frac{32}{2} = 16$\n\n**Step 5: Find corresponding values of $v$**\nFor Case 1: $u = 55$. From equation (3), $v = 71-u = 71-55 = 16$.\nFor Case 2: $u = 16$. From equation (3), $v = 71-u = 71-16 = 55$.\n\n**Step 6: Find $x$ and $y$ for each case**\nCase 1: $xy = 55$ and $x+y = 16$.\nWe are looking for two integers that multiply to 55 and add up to 16. The factors of 55 are 1, 5, 11, 55. We see that $5 \\times 11 = 55$ and $5+11 = 16$. So, we can have $\\{x, y\\} = \\{5, 11\\}$.\n\nCase 2: $xy = 16$ and $x+y = 55$.\nWe are looking for two integers that multiply to 16 and add up to 55. The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. The pairs are (1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4). For (1, 16), $1+16 = 17 \\neq 55$. For (2, 8), $2+8 = 10 \\neq 55$. For (4, 4), $4+4 = 8 \\neq 55$.  For (16, 1), $16+1 = 17 \\neq 55$. There are no integer solutions for this case that sum to 55.\n\nThus, we only consider Case 1, where $\\{x, y\\} = \\{5, 11\\}$. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, this solution is valid.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate $x^2+y^2$**\nFor $x=5$ and $y=11$ (or $x=11$ and $y=5$), we calculate $x^2+y^2$:\n\\[ x^2+y^2 = 5^2 + 11^2 = 25 + 121 = 146 \\]\n\n**Step 8: Verify the solution**\nCheck if $x=5, y=11$ satisfy the original equations:\nEquation 1: $xy+x+y = (5)(11)+5+11 = 55+5+11 = 71$. Correct.\nEquation 2: $x^2y+xy^2 = (5^2)(11)+(5)(11^2) = 25 \\times 11 + 5 \\times 121 = 275 + 605 = 880$. Correct.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{146}$",
