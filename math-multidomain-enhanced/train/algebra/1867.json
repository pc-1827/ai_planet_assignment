    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n- In an eight-term sequence $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H$, the value of the third term, $C$, is given as $5$.\n- The sum of any three consecutive terms in the sequence is constant and equal to $30$.\n- We need to determine the sum of the first term, $A$, and the last term, $H$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Sequence: $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H$ (eight terms)\n- Value of $C = 5$\n- Sum of any three consecutive terms $= 30$\n- Goal: Find $A+H$\n\n## Solution Strategy\nWe are given that the sum of any three consecutive terms is constant. We can write down equations for consecutive terms and use the given information to find relationships between the terms and ultimately find $A+H$.\n\nLet's write down the equations for the sums of consecutive terms:\n1. $A+B+C = 30$\n2. $B+C+D = 30$\n3. $C+D+E = 30$\n4. $D+E+F = 30$\n5. $E+F+G = 30$\n6. $F+G+H = 30$\n\nWe are given $C=5$. We will substitute this value into the equations and simplify them.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Substitute $C=5$ into the equations:**\n   - Equation 1: $A+B+5 = 30 \\implies A+B = 25$  (Equation 7)\n   - Equation 2: $B+5+D = 30 \\implies B+D = 25$  (Equation 8)\n   - Equation 3: $5+D+E = 30 \\implies D+E = 25$  (Equation 9)\n   - Equation 4: $D+E+F = 30 \\implies 25+F = 30 \\implies F = 5$  (Equation 10)\n   - Equation 5: $E+F+G = 30 \\implies E+5+G = 30 \\implies E+G = 25$  (Equation 11)\n   - Equation 6: $F+G+H = 30 \\implies 5+G+H = 30 \\implies G+H = 25$  (Equation 12)\n\n2. **Analyze the relationships between terms from the simplified equations:**\n   - From Equation 7 and Equation 8: $A+B = 25$ and $B+D = 25$.\n     This implies $A+B = B+D$, so $A = D$.\n   - From Equation 8 and Equation 9: $B+D = 25$ and $D+E = 25$.\n     This implies $B+D = D+E$, so $B = E$.\n   - From Equation 9 and Equation 11: $D+E = 25$ and $E+G = 25$.\n     This implies $D+E = E+G$, so $D = G$.\n   - From Equation 11 and Equation 12: $E+G = 25$ and $G+H = 25$.\n     This implies $E+G = G+H$, so $E = H$.\n\n3. **Summarize the relationships and known values:**\n   - $A = D = G$\n   - $B = E = H$\n   - $C = 5$\n   - $F = 5$\n   - $A+B = 25$ (from Equation 7)\n\n4. **Calculate $A+H$:**\n   - Since $H = B$, we have $A+H = A+B$.\n   - From Equation 7, we know $A+B = 25$.\n   - Therefore, $A+H = 25$.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   Let $A=10$, then from $A+B = 25$, $B = 15$.\n   Since $A=D=G$ and $B=E=H$, we have $D=10, G=10, E=15, H=15$.\n   We are given $C=5$ and we found $F=5$.\n   The sequence is $10, 15, 5, 10, 15, 5, 10, 15$.\n   Let's check if the sum of any three consecutive terms is $30$.\n   - $A+B+C = 10+15+5 = 30$\n   - $B+C+D = 15+5+10 = 30$\n   - $C+D+E = 5+10+15 = 30$\n   - $D+E+F = 10+15+5 = 30$\n   - $E+F+G = 15+5+10 = 30$\n   - $F+G+H = 5+10+15 = 30$\n   All conditions are satisfied. And $A+H = 10+15 = 25$.\n\n## Final Answer\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The final answer is $\\boxed{25}$",
