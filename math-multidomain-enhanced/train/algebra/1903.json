    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nFind the smallest possible distance between a point $A$ on the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 12x + 31 = 0$ and a point $B$ on the parabola $y^2 = 4x.$\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Point $A$ is on the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 12x + 31 = 0.$\n- Point $B$ is on the parabola $y^2 = 4x.$\n- We want to minimize the distance $AB.$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nThe strategy is to first find the shortest distance from the center of the circle to the parabola. Then, subtract the radius of the circle from this shortest distance to find the shortest distance between the circle and the parabola.\nWe will use the method of minimizing the squared distance between the center of the circle and a point on the parabola using calculus.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- Equation of a circle: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2,$ center $(h, k),$ radius $r.$\n- Equation of a parabola: $y^2 = 4ax,$ vertex $(0, 0),$ axis along the x-axis.\n- Distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2):$ $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nFirst, rewrite the equation of the circle in the standard form:\n$x^2 + y^2 - 12x + 31 = 0$\n$(x^2 - 12x) + y^2 + 31 = 0$\n$(x^2 - 12x + 36) + y^2 + 31 - 36 = 0$\n$(x - 6)^2 + y^2 - 5 = 0$\n$(x - 6)^2 + y^2 = 5$\nThe center of the circle is $C = (6, 0)$ and the radius is $r = \\sqrt{5}.$\n\nLet $B = (x, y)$ be a point on the parabola $y^2 = 4x.$ We want to minimize the distance between the center of the circle $C = (6, 0)$ and the point $B.$\nThe square of the distance $CB^2 = (x - 6)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = (x - 6)^2 + y^2.$\nSubstitute $y^2 = 4x$ into the expression for $CB^2:$\n$CB^2 = (x - 6)^2 + 4x = x^2 - 12x + 36 + 4x = x^2 - 8x + 36.$\nTo minimize $CB^2,$ we find the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(CB^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 8x + 36) = 2x - 8.$\nSet $2x - 8 = 0,$ which gives $x = 4.$\nWhen $x = 4,$ $y^2 = 4x = 4(4) = 16,$ so $y = \\pm 4.$\nThe points on the parabola closest to the center of the circle are $B_1 = (4, 4)$ and $B_2 = (4, -4).$\nThe minimum distance from the center $C = (6, 0)$ to the parabola is $CB = \\sqrt{(4 - 6)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 16} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}.$\n\nThe minimum distance from the center of the circle to the parabola is $2\\sqrt{5}.$ The radius of the circle is $r = \\sqrt{5}.$\nSince the minimum distance from the center to the parabola ($2\\sqrt{5}$) is greater than the radius ($\\sqrt{5}$), the circle and parabola do not intersect.\nThe shortest distance between the circle and the parabola is the minimum distance from the center to the parabola minus the radius of the circle:\nMinimum distance $AB = CB - r = 2\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{5}.$\n\nTo find the point $A$ on the circle closest to $B=(4,4)$, we move from the center $C=(6,0)$ towards $B=(4,4)$ by a distance of radius $r=\\sqrt{5}$.\nThe vector $\\vec{CB} = B - C = (4-6, 4-0) = (-2, 4).$\nThe unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{CB}$ is $\\frac{\\vec{CB}}{|\\vec{CB}|} = \\frac{(-2, 4)}{\\sqrt{20}} = \\frac{(-1, 2)}{\\sqrt{5}}.$\nThe point $A = C + r \\frac{\\vec{CB}}{|\\vec{CB}|} = (6, 0) + \\sqrt{5} \\frac{(-1, 2)}{\\sqrt{5}} = (6, 0) + (-1, 2) = (5, 2).$\nPoint $A=(5, 2)$ is on the circle because $(5-6)^2 + 2^2 = (-1)^2 + 4 = 5 = r^2.$\nThe distance $AB = \\sqrt{(5-4)^2 + (2-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1+4} = \\sqrt{5}.$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$",
