    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nGiven a sequence of integers $\\{a_k\\}$ defined by the recurrence relation $a_{m+n}=a_m+a_n+mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, and the initial condition $a_1=1$. The objective is to find the value of the term $a_{12}$ in this sequence.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Sequence $\\{a_k\\}$ of integers\n- Initial condition: $a_1 = 1$\n- Recurrence relation: $a_{m+n} = a_m + a_n + mn$ for positive integers $m, n$\n- Goal: Find $a_{12}$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will use the recurrence relation to iteratively calculate the terms of the sequence starting from $a_1=1$ until we reach $a_{12}.$ We will express each term $a_k$ as $a_{(k-1)+1} = a_{k-1} + a_1 + (k-1) \\times 1$ for $k=2, 3, \\dots, 12.$\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find a closed-form expression for $a_n$ and then substitute $n=12$. By calculating the first few terms, we observe a pattern that might lead to a closed-form formula.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nWe start with the given value $a_1 = 1$. We use the recurrence relation $a_{m+n} = a_m + a_n + mn$ to calculate subsequent terms. We will consistently use $n=1$ and vary $m$ to proceed step by step.\n\n1.  Calculate $a_2$:\n    Using $m=1, n=1$, we have $a_{1+1} = a_1 + a_1 + 1 \\times 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.$\n    So, $a_2 = 3.$\n\n2.  Calculate $a_3$:\n    Using $m=2, n=1$, we have $a_{2+1} = a_2 + a_1 + 2 \\times 1 = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6.$\n    So, $a_3 = 6.$\n\n3.  Calculate $a_4$:\n    Using $m=3, n=1$, we have $a_{3+1} = a_3 + a_1 + 3 \\times 1 = 6 + 1 + 3 = 10.$\n    So, $a_4 = 10.$\n\n4.  Calculate $a_5$:\n    Using $m=4, n=1$, we have $a_{4+1} = a_4 + a_1 + 4 \\times 1 = 10 + 1 + 4 = 15.$\n    So, $a_5 = 15.$\n\n5.  Calculate $a_6$:\n    Using $m=5, n=1$, we have $a_{5+1} = a_5 + a_1 + 5 \\times 1 = 15 + 1 + 5 = 21.$\n    So, $a_6 = 21.$\n\n6.  Calculate $a_7$:\n    Using $m=6, n=1$, we have $a_{6+1} = a_6 + a_1 + 6 \\times 1 = 21 + 1 + 6 = 28.$\n    So, $a_7 = 28.$\n\n7.  Calculate $a_8$:\n    Using $m=7, n=1$, we have $a_{7+1} = a_7 + a_1 + 7 \\times 1 = 28 + 1 + 7 = 36.$\n    So, $a_8 = 36.$\n\n8.  Calculate $a_9$:\n    Using $m=8, n=1$, we have $a_{8+1} = a_8 + a_1 + 8 \\times 1 = 36 + 1 + 8 = 45.$\n    So, $a_9 = 45.$\n\n9.  Calculate $a_{10}$:\n    Using $m=9, n=1$, we have $a_{9+1} = a_9 + a_1 + 9 \\times 1 = 45 + 1 + 9 = 55.$\n    So, $a_{10} = 55.$\n\n10. Calculate $a_{11}$:\n    Using $m=10, n=1$, we have $a_{10+1} = a_{10} + a_1 + 10 \\times 1 = 55 + 1 + 10 = 66.$\n    So, $a_{11} = 66.$\n\n11. Calculate $a_{12}$:\n    Using $m=11, n=1$, we have $a_{11+1} = a_{11} + a_1 + 11 \\times 1 = 66 + 1 + 11 = 78.$\n    So, $a_{12} = 78.$\n\n### 4.
