    "solution": "The given solution is already well-structured, logically sound, and easy to follow. The steps are clearly laid out and the use of Vieta's formulas is correctly applied. The algebraic manipulations are accurate, leading to the correct derivation of $a+c=121$ and the final answer $a+b+c+d = 1210.$\n\nTo further enhance the solution, we can add a concluding remark that summarizes the key steps and reinforces the answer.\n\n**Concluding Remark:**\nBy applying Vieta's formulas to the given quadratic equations, we established a system of equations relating $a, b, c, d.$  Through algebraic manipulation and subtraction of derived equations, we found the crucial relationship $a + c = 121.$  Finally, using the sum of roots equations, we determined that $a + b + c + d = 10(a + c),$ which yields the final answer $1210.$  This result is consistent with the problem conditions and the distinctness of $a, b, c, d.$\n\n**Improved Solution (incorporating the concluding remark):**\n\n## Problem Statement\n- Given that $a, b, c, d$ are distinct real numbers.\n- The roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 10ax - 11b = 0$ are $c$ and $d$.\n- The roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 10cx - 11d = 0$ are $a$ and $b$.\n- Find the value of $a + b + c + d$.\n\n## Solution Strategy\n1. Use Vieta's formulas to relate the roots and coefficients of the given quadratic equations.\n2. Form a system of equations based on Vieta's formulas.\n3. Solve the system of equations to find a relationship between $a, b, c, d$.\n4. Calculate the value of $a + b + c + d$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Apply Vieta's formulas to the first quadratic equation:** $x^2 - 10ax - 11b = 0$ with roots $c$ and $d$.\n   - Sum of roots: $c + d = -(-10a)/1 = 10a$  (Equation 1)\n   - Product of roots: $cd = -11b/1 = -11b$  (Equation 2)\n\n2. **Apply Vieta's formulas to the second quadratic equation:** $x^2 - 10cx - 11d = 0$ with roots $a$ and $b$.\n   - Sum of roots: $a + b = -(-10c)/1 = 10c$  (Equation 3)\n   - Product of roots: $ab = -11d/1 = -11d$  (Equation 4)\n\n3. **From Equations 1 and 3, express $b$ and $d$ in terms of $a$ and $c$**:\n   - From Equation 1: $d = 10a - c$\n   - From Equation 3: $b = 10c - a$\n\n4. **Substitute the expressions for $b$ and $d$ into Equations 2 and 4**:\n   - Substitute $d = 10a - c$ and $b = 10c - a$ into Equation 2:\n     $c(10a - c) = -11(10c - a)$\n     $10ac - c^2 = -110c + 11a$\n     $c^2 - 10ac - 110c + 11a = 0$  (Equation 5)\n\n   - Substitute $d = 10a - c$ and $b = 10c - a$ into Equation 4:\n     $a(10c - a) = -11(10a - c)$\n     $10ac - a^2 = -110a + 11c$\n     $a^2 - 10ac - 110a + 11c = 0$  (Equation 6)\n\n5. **Subtract Equation 6 from Equation 5**:\n   $(c^2 - 10ac - 110c + 11a) - (a^2 - 10ac - 110a + 11c) = 0$\n   $c^2 - a^2 - 110c + 11a + 110a - 11c = 0$\n   $c^2 - a^2 - 121c + 121a = 0$\n   $(c^2 - a^2) - 121(c - a) = 0$\n   $(c - a)(c + a) - 121(c - a) = 0$\n   $(c - a)(c + a - 121) = 0$\n\n6. **Since $a$ and $c$ are distinct, $c - a \\neq 0$. Thus, we must have**:\n   $c + a - 121 = 0$\n   $a + c = 121$\n\n7. **Find $a + b + c + d$**:\n   We know from Equation 1 and Equation 3 that $c + d = 10a$ and $a + b = 10c$.\n   $a + b + c + d = (a + c) + (b + d) = (a + c) + (10c - a + 10a - c) = (a+c) + 9a + 9c = 10(a+c)$.\n   Alternatively, $a + b + c + d = (a + b) + (c + d) = 10c + 10a = 10(a + c)$.\n   Since $a + c = 121$,\n   $a + b + c + d = 10(121) = 1210$.\n\n**Concluding Remark:**\nBy applying Vieta's formulas to the given quadratic equations, we established a system of equations relating $a, b, c, d.$  Through algebraic manipulation, we found the crucial relationship $a + c = 121.$  Finally, using the sum of roots equations, we determined that $a + b + c + d = 10(a + c),$ which yields the final answer $1210.$  This result is consistent with the problem conditions and the distinctness of $a, b, c, d.$\n\n## Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1210}$",
