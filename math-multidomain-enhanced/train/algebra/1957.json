    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nLet $(x, y)$ be a solution to the system of equations\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{y\\} &= 2.4, \\\\ \\{x\\} + \\lfloor y \\rfloor &= 5.1. \\end{aligned} \\]\nHere, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ (the floor function), and $\\{x\\} = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denotes the fractional part of $x$. We are asked to compute the value of $|x - y|.$\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $x, y$ are real numbers.\n- $\\lfloor x \\rfloor, \\lfloor y \\rfloor$ are integers.\n- $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$ and $0 \\le \\{y\\} < 1$.\n- We have a system of two equations involving floor and fractional part functions.\n- We need to find $|x - y|$.\n\n## Solution Strategy\nWe will use the properties of floor and fractional part functions to solve the system of equations.\nFrom the given equations, we will isolate the integer and fractional parts and determine their values.\nThen we will find the values of $x$ and $y$ and compute $|x - y|$.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- For any real number $x$, $x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\}$, where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is an integer and $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Analyze the first equation:** $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{y\\} = 2.4$.\n   - Since $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is an integer and $0 \\le \\{y\\} < 1$, we can deduce the possible value of $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$.\n   - We know that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2.4 - \\{y\\}$.\n   - Since $0 \\le \\{y\\} < 1$, we have $2.4 - 1 < 2.4 - \\{y\\} \\le 2.4 - 0$, which means $1.4 < \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le 2.4$.\n   - As $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ must be an integer, the only integer in the interval $(1.4, 2.4]$ is $2$.\n   - Therefore, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2$.\n   - Substituting $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2$ into the first equation, we get $2 + \\{y\\} = 2.4$.\n   - Solving for $\\{y\\}$, we have $\\{y\\} = 2.4 - 2 = 0.4$.\n   - Since $0 \\le 0.4 < 1$, this is a valid value for the fractional part of $y$.\n\n2. **Analyze the second equation:** $\\{x\\} + \\lfloor y \\rfloor = 5.1$.\n   - Similarly, since $\\lfloor y \\rfloor$ is an integer and $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$, we can deduce the possible value of $\\lfloor y \\rfloor$.\n   - We know that $\\lfloor y \\rfloor = 5.1 - \\{x\\}$.\n   - Since $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$, we have $5.1 - 1 < 5.1 - \\{x\\} \\le 5.1 - 0$, which means $4.1 < \\lfloor y \\rfloor \\le 5.1$.\n   - As $\\lfloor y \\rfloor$ must be an integer, the only integer in the interval $(4.1, 5.1]$ is $5$.\n   - Therefore, $\\lfloor y \\rfloor = 5$.\n   - Substituting $\\lfloor y \\rfloor = 5$ into the second equation, we get $\\{x\\} + 5 = 5.1$.\n   - Solving for $\\{x\\}$, we have $\\{x\\} = 5.1 - 5 = 0.1$.\n   - Since $0 \\le 0.1 < 1$, this is a valid value for the fractional part of $x$.\n\n3. **Find $x$ and $y$:**\n   - We have $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2$ and $\\{x\\} = 0.1$. Thus, $x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\} = 2 + 0.1 = 2.1$.\n   - We have $\\lfloor y \\rfloor = 5$ and $\\{y\\} = 0.4$. Thus, $y = \\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\{y\\} = 5 + 0.4 = 5.4$.\n\n4. **Compute $|x - y|$:**\n   - $|x - y| = |2.1 - 5.4| = |-3.3| = 3.3$.\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - For $x = 2.1$ and $y = 5.4$:\n     - $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{y\\} = \\lfloor 2.1 \\rfloor + \\{5.4\\} = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4$. (Equation 1 is satisfied)\n     - $\\{x\\} + \\lfloor y \\rfloor = \\{2.1\\} + \\lfloor 5.4 \\rfloor = 0.1 + 5 = 5.1$. (Equation 2 is satisfied)\n\n## Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3.3}$",
