    "solution": "```\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nFind all possible values of the real number $k$ such that the graphs of $|z - 3| = 2|z + 3|$ and $|z| = k$ intersect in exactly one point in the complex plane.\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- $z$: complex variable\n- $k$: a real number, represents the radius of the circle $|z| = k$. We must have $k \\ge 0$ because $|z| \\ge 0$. For $|z|=k$ to be a circle, we need $k > 0$. If $k=0$, $|z|=0$ represents just the origin (a point).\n- The intersection must be exactly one point.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nFirst, we will simplify the equation $|z - 3| = 2|z + 3|$ and identify the geometric shape it represents in the complex plane. We will convert it into Cartesian coordinates form by substituting $z = x + yi$.\nSecond, we recognize that $|z| = k$ represents a circle centered at the origin with radius $k$ (if $k>0$) or a point at the origin (if $k=0$).\nThird, for two circles to intersect at exactly one point, they must be tangent. We will use the geometric condition for tangency between two circles. We will consider both cases of tangency: external and internal. We also need to consider the case when $|z|=k$ is a point (when $k=0$) and check for intersection with the other graph.\n\n**Relevant Formulas/Theorems:**\n- For $z = x + yi$, $|z - a| = \\sqrt{(x-a_x)^2 + (y-a_y)^2}$ where $a = a_x + a_yi$.\n- Equation of a circle with center $(h, j)$ and radius $r$ is $(x - h)^2 + (y - j)^2 = r^2$.\n- For two circles with centers $C_1, C_2$ and radii $r_1, r_2$, the distance between centers $d = |C_1 C_2|$.\n    - Circles are externally tangent if $d = r_1 + r_2$.\n    - Circles are internally tangent if $d = |r_1 - r_2|$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify $|z - 3| = 2|z + 3|$**\nLet $z = x + yi$.\n$|x + yi - 3| = 2|x + yi + 3|$\n$|(x - 3) + yi| = 2|(x + 3) + yi|$\n$\\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + y^2} = 2\\sqrt{(x + 3)^2 + y^2}$\nSquaring both sides:\n$(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4((x + 3)^2 + y^2)$\n$x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = 4(x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2)$\n$x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = 4x^2 + 24x + 36 + 4y^2$\n$3x^2 + 30x + 3y^2 + 27 = 0$\nDivide by 3:\n$x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 9 = 0$\nComplete the square for $x$ terms:\n$(x^2 + 10x + 25) + y^2 + 9 - 25 = 0$\n$(x + 5)^2 + y^2 = 16 = 4^2$\nThis is a circle $C_1$ centered at $(-5, 0)$ with radius $r_1 = 4$. In complex form, center $C_1 = -5$ and radius $r_1 = 4$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify $|z| = k$**\n$|z| = k$ represents a circle $C_2$ centered at the origin $(0, 0)$ with radius $r_2 = k$. In complex form, center $C_2 = 0$ and radius $r_2 = k$. We consider $k \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Condition for exactly one intersection point (Tangency for $k>0$)**\nFor $k>0$, we have two circles. For exactly one intersection point, they must be tangent.\nThe distance between the centers of the two circles is $d = |C_1 - C_2| = |-5 - 0| = 5$.\nFor tangency, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: External Tangency: $d = r_1 + r_2$\n$5 = 4 + k \\implies k = 1$\n\nCase 2: Internal Tangency: $d = |r_1 - r_2|$\n$5 = |4 - k|$\nThis gives two possibilities:\n$4 - k = 5 \\implies k = 4 - 5 = -1$ (Not valid since $k \\ge 0$)\n$4 - k = -5 \\implies k = 4 - (-5) = 9$\n\nSo, possible positive values of $k$ are $1$ and $9$.\n\n**Step 4: Check $k=0$ case**\nIf $k = 0$, $|z| = 0 \\implies z = 0$.  We check if $z=0$ is on $|z - 3| = 2|z + 3|$.\n$|0 - 3| = |-3| = 3$. $2|0 + 3| = 2|3| = 6$. $3 \\neq 6$.  So $z=0$ is not on the first graph.  Therefore, for $k=0$, there is no intersection.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\nWe found possible values $k=1$ and $k=9$ for exactly one intersection point (tangency). The case $k=0$ gives no intersection. Thus, the possible values for $k$ are $1$ and $9$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1,9}$\n```",
