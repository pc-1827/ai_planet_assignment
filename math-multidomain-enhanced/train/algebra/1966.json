    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven that $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are the first three terms of a geometric sequence and $a_1 = 1,$ we want to find the smallest possible value of the expression $4a_2 + 5a_3.$\n\n- **Key Variables:**\n    - $a_1, a_2, a_3$: terms of a geometric sequence\n    - $a_1 = 1$: first term is given\n    - $r$: common ratio of the geometric sequence\n\n- **Constraint:**\n    - The sequence must be geometric.\n\n- **Objective:**\n    - Minimize the expression $4a_2 + 5a_3.$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant common ratio, $r.$\nGiven $a_1 = 1,$ we can express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $r.$\n$a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$\n$a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$\n\nSubstitute these expressions for $a_2$ and $a_3$ into the expression $4a_2 + 5a_3$ to get an expression in terms of $r$ only.\n$E = 4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2 = 5r^2 + 4r$\n\nTo find the minimum value of this quadratic expression in $r,$ we can use calculus or complete the square. Since the coefficient of $r^2$ is positive ($5 > 0$), the parabola opens upwards, and there exists a minimum value. We can find the vertex of the parabola to determine the minimum value. The $r$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola $Ar^2 + Br + C$ is given by $r = -B / (2A).$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nGiven $a_1 = 1$ and the sequence is geometric with common ratio $r.$\nThe terms are:\n$a_1 = 1$\n$a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$\n$a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$\n\nThe expression to minimize is $4a_2 + 5a_3.$\nSubstitute $a_2 = r$ and $a_3 = r^2$ into the expression:\n$E(r) = 4r + 5r^2 = 5r^2 + 4r$\n\nThis is a quadratic function in $r$ of the form $Ar^2 + Br + C,$ with $A = 5,$ $B = 4,$ and $C = 0.$\nThe $r$-coordinate of the vertex (where the minimum occurs) is given by:\n$r_v = -\\frac{B}{2A} = -\\frac{4}{2 \\cdot 5} = -\\frac{4}{10} = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nTo find the minimum value of the expression, substitute $r_v = -\\frac{2}{5}$ back into $E(r) = 5r^2 + 4r:$\n$E_{min} = 5 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 + 4 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)$\n$E_{min} = 5 \\left(\\frac{4}{25}\\right) - \\frac{8}{5}$\n$E_{min} = \\frac{20}{25} - \\frac{8}{5}$\n$E_{min} = \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{8}{5}$\n$E_{min} = \\frac{4 - 8}{5} = \\frac{-4}{5}$\n\nTo confirm that this is a minimum, we can check the second derivative of $E(r) = 5r^2 + 4r.$\n$E'(r) = 10r + 4$\n$E''(r) = 10$\nSince $E''(r) = 10 > 0,$ the function $E(r)$ is concave up, so $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$ corresponds to a minimum value.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}.$\n\nVerification:\nFor $r = -\\frac{2}{5},$ the first three terms are:\n$a_1 = 1$\n$a_2 = r = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n$a_3 = r^2 = \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{25}$\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + 5 \\left(\\frac{4}{25}\\right) = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{20}{25} = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} = -\\frac{4}{5}.$\nThis confirms that the minimum value is indeed $-\\frac{4}{5}.$",
