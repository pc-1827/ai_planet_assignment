    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nLet $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be three positive real numbers.\nGiven that their sum is 1, i.e., $x+y+z=1$.\nAlso, no one of these numbers is more than twice any other. This means the following conditions must be satisfied:\n$x \\le 2y, \\quad x \\le 2z$\n$y \\le 2x, \\quad y \\le 2z$\n$z \\le 2x, \\quad z \\le 2y$\n\nWe are asked to find the minimum value of the product $xyz.$\n\n### Solution Strategy\nWe want to minimize the product $xyz$ under the given constraints. Intuitively, the minimum product will be achieved when the numbers are as unequal as possible, while still satisfying the given condition that no number is more than twice any other. We will consider the boundary cases where at least one of the inequalities becomes an equality. We will examine the cases where one number is exactly twice another. We will check extreme points within the feasible region defined by the inequalities and the sum constraint.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\nLet us assume without loss of generality that $x \\ge y \\ge z.$ Then the condition that no one of these numbers is more than twice any other reduces to two conditions:\n1. $x \\le 2z$ (largest is no more than twice the smallest)\n2. $y \\ge \\frac{1}{2}z$ (middle is at least half of the smallest, which is automatically true as $y \\ge z > \\frac{1}{2}z$)\n3. $y \\le 2z$ (middle is no more than twice the smallest)\n4. $x \\le 2y$ (largest is no more than twice the middle)\n5. $z \\ge \\frac{1}{2}x$ (smallest is at least half of the largest, which is equivalent to $x \\le 2z$)\n6. $z \\ge \\frac{1}{2}y$ (smallest is at least half of the middle, which is equivalent to $y \\le 2z$)\n\nThus, for $x \\ge y \\ge z,$ the conditions are $x \\le 2z$ and $y \\le 2z$ and $x \\le 2y$.\nSince we assumed $x \\ge y \\ge z,$ we have $x+y+z=1$ and $x \\le 2z,$ $y \\le 2z,$ $x \\le 2y.$\n\nLet us consider the case when $x = 2z.$  Then the conditions become $2z \\le 2y \\implies z \\le y,$ which is true since $y \\ge z.$ And $y \\le 2z.$\nSo we have $x = 2z$ and $z \\le y \\le 2z.$\nSince $x+y+z=1,$ we have $2z+y+z=1 \\implies y = 1-3z.$\nThe condition $z \\le y \\le 2z$ becomes $z \\le 1-3z \\le 2z.$\n$z \\le 1-3z \\implies 4z \\le 1 \\implies z \\le \\frac{1}{4}.$\n$1-3z \\le 2z \\implies 1 \\le 5z \\implies z \\ge \\frac{1}{5}.$\nSo we have $\\frac{1}{5} \\le z \\le \\frac{1}{4}.$\nWe want to minimize $xyz = (2z)(1-3z)z = 2z^2(1-3z) = 2z^2 - 6z^3$ for $z \\in [\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{4}].$\nLet $f(z) = 2z^2 - 6z^3.$ Then $f'(z) = 4z - 18z^2 = 2z(2-9z).$\nFor $z \\in [\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{4}],$ $2-9z = 2-9z.$\nAt $z = 1/4,$ $2-9z = 2 - 9/4 = -1/4 < 0.$ $f'(1/4) < 0.$\nAt $z = 1/5,$ $2-9z = 2 - 9/5 = 1/5 > 0.$ $f'(1/5) > 0.$\nThe function is decreasing in the interval $[\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{4}].$\nSo the minimum value is at $z = \\frac{1}{4}.$\nWhen $z = \\frac{1}{4},$ $x = 2z = \\frac{1}{2},$ $y = 1-3z = 1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}.$\nSo $(x,y,z) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}).$\nThe product $xyz = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{32}.$\n\nLet's check the conditions for $(x,y,z) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}).$\n$x+y+z = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1.$\n$x = \\frac{1}{2}, y = \\frac{1}{4}, z = \\frac{1}{4}.$\n$x \\le 2y \\implies \\frac{1}{2} \\le 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$ (True)\n$x \\le 2z \\implies \\frac{1}{2} \\le 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$ (True)\n$y \\le 2x \\implies \\frac{1}{4} \\le 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ (True)\n$y \\le 2z \\implies \\frac{1}{4} \\le 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$ (True)\n$z \\le 2x \\implies \\frac{1}{4} \\le 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ (True)\n$z \\le 2y \\implies \\frac{1}{4} \\le 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$ (True)\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$",
