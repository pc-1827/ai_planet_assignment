    "solution": "## Solution\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   - The problem is to find the smallest possible value of the coefficient $a$ in the polynomial $x^3 -ax^2 + bx -2010$, given that the polynomial has three positive integer roots.\n   - Key variables:\n     - Polynomial: $P(x) = x^3 -ax^2 + bx -2010$\n     - Roots: $r_1, r_2, r_3$ (positive integers)\n     - Coefficient $a$: sum of the roots\n     - Constraint: $r_1r_2r_3 = 2010$\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   - Use Vieta's formulas to relate the roots and coefficients of the polynomial.\n   - We are given that the product of the roots is 2010 and the sum of the roots is $a$.\n   - To minimize $a$, we need to find three positive integer factors of 2010 whose sum is as small as possible.\n   - Factorize 2010 into prime factors.\n   - Explore different combinations of these prime factors to form three roots and calculate their sum.\n   - Compare the sums to find the smallest possible value of $a$.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - Let $r_1, r_2, r_3$ be the three positive integer roots of the polynomial $x^3 -ax^2 + bx -2010$.\n   - According to Vieta's formulas, we have:\n     \\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} r_1 + r_2 + r_3 &= a \\\\ r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 &= b \\\\ r_1r_2r_3 &= 2010\\end{align*}\n   - We want to minimize $a = r_1 + r_2 + r_3$, given that $r_1r_2r_3 = 2010$ and $r_1, r_2, r_3$ are positive integers.\n   - First, find the prime factorization of 2010:\n     $2010 = 201 \\times 10 = (3 \\times 67) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 67$.\n   - To minimize the sum $r_1 + r_2 + r_3$ for a fixed product $r_1r_2r_3 = 2010$, we should choose $r_1, r_2, r_3$ to be as close to each other as possible.\n   - We consider different ways to partition the prime factors $\\{2, 3, 5, 67\\}$ into three groups to form $r_1, r_2, r_3$:\n     - Case 1: $r_1 = 2$, $r_2 = 3$, $r_3 = 5 \\times 67 = 335$. Sum $a = 2 + 3 + 335 = 340$.\n     - Case 2: $r_1 = 2$, $r_2 = 5$, $r_3 = 3 \\times 67 = 201$. Sum $a = 2 + 5 + 201 = 208$.\n     - Case 3: $r_1 = 2$, $r_2 = 3 \\times 5 = 15$, $r_3 = 67$. Sum $a = 2 + 15 + 67 = 84$.\n     - Case 4: $r_1 = 3$, $r_2 = 5$, $r_3 = 2 \\times 67 = 134$. Sum $a = 3 + 5 + 134 = 142$.\n     - Case 5: $r_1 = 3$, $r_2 = 2 \\times 5 = 10$, $r_3 = 67$. Sum $a = 3 + 10 + 67 = 80$.\n     - Case 6: $r_1 = 5$, $r_2 = 2 \\times 3 = 6$, $r_3 = 67$. Sum $a = 5 + 6 + 67 = 78$.\n   - Comparing these sums, the smallest sum is 78, which corresponds to roots $r_1 = 5, r_2 = 6, r_3 = 67$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   - The smallest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{78}$.\n   - Verification:\n     - Roots are 5, 6, 67, which are positive integers.\n     - Product of roots: $5 \\times 6 \\times 67 = 30 \\times 67 = 2010$.\n     - Sum of roots: $a = 5 + 6 + 67 = 78$.\n     - The polynomial is $(x-5)(x-6)(x-67) = x^3 - 78x^2 + 767x - 2010$.\n     - The coefficient of $x^2$ is indeed $-a = -78$, so $a = 78$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{78}$",
