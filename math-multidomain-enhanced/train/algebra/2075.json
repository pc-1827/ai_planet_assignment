    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nThe problem is stated as follows:\nGiven a polynomial $2x^3 + bx + 7,$ it is known that it has a factor of the form $x^2 + px + 1.$ We need to determine the value of the coefficient $b.$\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Polynomial $P(x) = 2x^3 + bx + 7$\n- Factor $Q(x) = x^2 + px + 1$\n- We need to find the value of $b.$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nSince $x^2 + px + 1$ is a factor of $2x^3 + bx + 7,$ it means that when we divide $2x^3 + bx + 7$ by $x^2 + px + 1,$ the remainder must be zero.\nAlternatively, since $x^2 + px + 1$ is a quadratic factor of a cubic polynomial $2x^3 + bx + 7,$ the other factor must be a linear polynomial. We can express the cubic polynomial as a product of the quadratic factor and a linear factor, and then compare coefficients to find the value of $b.$\nWe will use the method of equating coefficients.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nLet the linear factor be $Ax + C.$ Then we can write the cubic polynomial as:\n$2x^3 + bx + 7 = (x^2 + px + 1)(Ax + C).$\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n$(x^2 + px + 1)(Ax + C) = x^2(Ax + C) + px(Ax + C) + 1(Ax + C)$\n$= Ax^3 + Cx^2 + Apx^2 + Cpx + Ax + C$\n$= Ax^3 + (C + Ap)x^2 + (Cp + A)x + C.$\n\nNow we compare the coefficients of the expanded form with the given polynomial $2x^3 + bx + 7 = 2x^3 + 0x^2 + bx + 7.$\nBy equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of $x,$ we get the following system of equations:\n\nCoefficient of $x^3$: $A = 2$\nCoefficient of $x^2$: $C + Ap = 0$\nCoefficient of $x$: $Cp + A = b$\nConstant term: $C = 7$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $A = 2.$\nFrom the fourth equation, we have $C = 7.$\nSubstitute $A = 2$ and $C = 7$ into the second equation:\n$7 + 2p = 0$\n$2p = -7$\n$p = -\\frac{7}{2}.$\n\nNow substitute $C = 7,$ $p = -\\frac{7}{2},$ and $A = 2$ into the third equation to find $b$:\n$b = Cp + A = 7\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 2 = -\\frac{49}{2} + 2 = -\\frac{49}{2} + \\frac{4}{2} = -\\frac{45}{2}.$\n\nThus, $b = -\\frac{45}{2}.$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nTo verify the answer, substitute $b = -\\frac{45}{2}$ and $p = -\\frac{7}{2}$ into the polynomials.\nThe polynomial is $2x^3 - \\frac{45}{2}x + 7.$\nThe factor is $x^2 - \\frac{7}{2}x + 1.$\nThe other linear factor is $2x + 7$ (since $A=2, C=7$).\nLet's multiply $(x^2 - \\frac{7}{2}x + 1)(2x + 7)$:\n$(x^2 - \\frac{7}{2}x + 1)(2x + 7) = x^2(2x + 7) - \\frac{7}{2}x(2x + 7) + 1(2x + 7)$\n$= 2x^3 + 7x^2 - 7x^2 - \\frac{49}{2}x + 2x + 7$\n$= 2x^3 + (7x^2 - 7x^2) + (2x - \\frac{49}{2}x) + 7$\n$= 2x^3 + 0x^2 + (\\frac{4}{2}x - \\frac{49}{2}x) + 7$\n$= 2x^3 - \\frac{45}{2}x + 7.$\nThis matches the given polynomial with $b = -\\frac{45}{2}.$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-\\frac{45}{2}}$",
