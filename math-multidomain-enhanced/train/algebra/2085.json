Problem Statement**\n\nFind the area of the quadrilateral formed by the four complex numbers $z$ that satisfy the equation $z \\overline{z}^3 + \\overline{z} z^3 = 350$, and whose real and imaginary parts are integers. These complex numbers are considered as vertices in the complex plane.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Equation: $z \\overline{z}^3 + \\overline{z} z^3 = 350$\n- Constraint: Real and imaginary parts of $z$ are integers.\n- Goal: Find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the solutions in the complex plane.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nFirst, we will simplify the given equation using the property $|z|^2 = z \\overline{z}$. Then, we will express $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts, $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. We will substitute this into the simplified equation and solve for integer values of $x$ and $y$. Once we find the four complex numbers, we will treat them as vertices in the complex plane and calculate the area of the quadrilateral formed by these vertices.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- $|z|^2 = z \\overline{z}$\n- $z = x + yi \\implies \\overline{z} = x - yi$\n- Area of rectangle = length $\\times$ width\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the given equation.**\nGiven equation: $z \\overline{z}^3 + \\overline{z} z^3 = 350$\nFactor out $z \\overline{z}$:\n$(z \\overline{z}) \\overline{z}^2 + (\\overline{z} z) z^2 = 350$\n$|z|^2 \\overline{z}^2 + |z|^2 z^2 = 350$\n$|z|^2 (\\overline{z}^2 + z^2) = 350$\n\n**Step 2: Express in terms of real and imaginary parts.**\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then $|z|^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n$z^2 = (x+yi)^2 = x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 = (x^2 - y^2) + 2xyi$.\n$\\overline{z}^2 = (x-yi)^2 = x^2 - 2xyi - y^2 = (x^2 - y^2) - 2xyi$.\n$\\overline{z}^2 + z^2 = [(x^2 - y^2) - 2xyi] + [(x^2 - y^2) + 2xyi] = 2(x^2 - y^2)$.\n\nSubstitute back into the simplified equation:\n$(x^2 + y^2) [2(x^2 - y^2)] = 350$\n$2(x^2 + y^2)(x^2 - y^2) = 350$\n$(x^2 + y^2)(x^2 - y^2) = 175$\n$x^4 - y^4 = 175$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for integer solutions.**\nFactor $175 = 5^2 \\times 7$. We need to find factors of 175 that can be expressed as $x^2-y^2$ and $x^2+y^2$.\nLet $A = x^2 - y^2$ and $B = x^2 + y^2$. We have $AB = 175$ and $B > A$.\nPossible pairs of factors $(A, B)$ are $(1, 175), (5, 35), (7, 25)$.\n\nCase 1: $x^2 - y^2 = 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 175$.\nAdding the equations: $2x^2 = 176 \\implies x^2 = 88$. $x = \\pm \\sqrt{88}$, not integer.\n\nCase 2: $x^2 - y^2 = 5$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 35$.\nAdding the equations: $2x^2 = 40 \\implies x^2 = 20$. $x = \\pm \\sqrt{20}$, not integer.\n\nCase 3: $x^2 - y^2 = 7$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.\nAdding the equations: $2x^2 = 32 \\implies x^2 = 16 \\implies x = \\pm 4$.\nSubtracting the equations: $2y^2 = 18 \\implies y^2 = 9 \\implies y = \\pm 3$.\nInteger solutions are $x = \\pm 4$ and $y = \\pm 3$.\n\nThe four complex numbers are:\n$z_1 = 4 + 3i$, $z_2 = 4 - 3i$, $z_3 = -4 + 3i$, $z_4 = -4 - 3i$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the quadrilateral.**\nThe vertices in the complex plane are $(4, 3), (4, -3), (-4, 3), (-4, -3)$.\nThese vertices form a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes.\nThe length of the horizontal side is the distance between $(4, 3)$ and $(-4, 3)$ (or $(4, -3)$ and $(-4, -3)$), which is $|4 - (-4)| = 8$.\nThe length of the vertical side is the distance between $(4, 3)$ and $(4, -3)$ (or $(-4, 3)$ and $(-4, -3)$), which is $|3 - (-3)| = 6$.\nArea of the rectangle = length $\\times$ width = $8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{48}$",
