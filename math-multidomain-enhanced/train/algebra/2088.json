    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n### 1. Problem Statement\nFind a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree four (quartic) in the variable $x$ that satisfies the following conditions:\n- **Monic:** The leading coefficient (coefficient of $x^4$) is 1.\n- **Rational Coefficients:** All coefficients of the polynomial are rational numbers.\n- **Roots:** $2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $1-\\sqrt{3}$ are roots of the polynomial $P(x)=0$.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nSince the polynomial has rational coefficients, if a number of the form $a+\\sqrt{b}$ (where $a$ and $b$ are rational and $\\sqrt{b}$ is irrational) is a root, then its conjugate $a-\\sqrt{b}$ must also be a root.\n\nGiven roots are $2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $1-\\sqrt{3}$.\n- For the root $2+\\sqrt{2}$, the conjugate is $2-\\sqrt{2}$.\n- For the root $1-\\sqrt{3}$, the conjugate is $1+\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThus, the four roots of the quartic polynomial must be $2+\\sqrt{2}, 2-\\sqrt{2}, 1-\\sqrt{3}, 1+\\sqrt{3}$.\nWe can construct the polynomial by multiplying the linear factors corresponding to each root.\nIf $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4$ are the roots of a monic quartic polynomial, then the polynomial is given by $P(x) = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)(x-r_4)$.\nWe will first multiply the factors associated with conjugate pairs to ensure rational coefficients in intermediate steps.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Form quadratic factor from roots $2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $2-\\sqrt{2}$.**\nThe quadratic factor corresponding to the roots $2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $2-\\sqrt{2}$ is:\n$[x - (2+\\sqrt{2})][x - (2-\\sqrt{2})] = [(x-2) - \\sqrt{2}][(x-2) + \\sqrt{2}]$\nUsing the difference of squares formula $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$ with $a = x-2$ and $b = \\sqrt{2}$, we get:\n$(x-2)^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^2 = (x^2 - 4x + 4) - 2 = x^2 - 4x + 2$.\nLet $Q_1(x) = x^2 - 4x + 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Form quadratic factor from roots $1-\\sqrt{3}$ and $1+\\sqrt{3}$.**\nThe quadratic factor corresponding to the roots $1-\\sqrt{3}$ and $1+\\sqrt{3}$ is:\n$[x - (1-\\sqrt{3})][x - (1+\\sqrt{3})] = [(x-1) + \\sqrt{3}][(x-1) - \\sqrt{3}]$\nUsing the difference of squares formula $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$ with $a = x-1$ and $b = \\sqrt{3}$, we get:\n$(x-1)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = (x^2 - 2x + 1) - 3 = x^2 - 2x - 2$.\nLet $Q_2(x) = x^2 - 2x - 2$.\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the quadratic factors to obtain the quartic polynomial.**\nThe required quartic polynomial $P(x)$ is the product of $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$:\n$P(x) = Q_1(x) \\cdot Q_2(x) = (x^2 - 4x + 2)(x^2 - 2x - 2)$\nExpanding the product:\n$P(x) = x^2(x^2 - 2x - 2) - 4x(x^2 - 2x - 2) + 2(x^2 - 2x - 2)$\n$P(x) = x^4 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 + 8x + 2x^2 - 4x - 4$\nCombine like terms:\n$P(x) = x^4 + (-2x^3 - 4x^3) + (-2x^2 + 8x^2 + 2x^2) + (8x - 4x) - 4$\n$P(x) = x^4 - 6x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x - 4$\n\n**Step 4: Verify the conditions.**\n- **Monic:** The coefficient of $x^4$ is 1, so the polynomial is monic.\n- **Rational Coefficients:** The coefficients are $1, -6, 8, 4, -4$, which are all rational numbers (integers in this case).\n- **Roots:** By construction, $2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $1-\\sqrt{3}$ are roots of $P(x)$. We can also verify that the coefficients of $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ are rational, which ensures that the roots of $Q_1(x)=0$ are $2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$ and the roots of $Q_2(x)=0$ are $1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe required monic quartic polynomial is $\\boxed{x^4 - 6x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x - 4}$.\n\nVerification:\nLet $P(x) = x^4 - 6x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x - 4$.\nWe have constructed $P(x)$ such that it has roots $2+\\sqrt{2}, 2-\\sqrt{2}, 1-\\sqrt{3}, 1+\\sqrt{3}$.\nTherefore, $2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $1-\\sqrt{3}$ are roots of the polynomial.\nThe polynomial is monic because the leading coefficient is 1.\nThe coefficients are $1, -6, 8, 4, -4$, which are rational.\nAll conditions are satisfied.",
