    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nFind the equation of the other asymptote of a hyperbola, given that:\n- One asymptote has the equation $y = 3x$.\n- The foci of the hyperbola have the same $x$-coordinate, which is $5$.\nThe answer must be in the form $y = mx + b$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Asymptote 1: $y = 3x$\n- Foci $x$-coordinate: $5$ (implies vertical transverse axis)\n- Need to find the equation of the other asymptote.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nSince the foci have the same $x$-coordinate, the hyperbola has a vertical transverse axis. The center of the hyperbola will have the same $x$-coordinate as the foci.\nLet the center of the hyperbola be $(h, k)$. Then $h = 5$.\nThe equations of the asymptotes for a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis and center $(h, k)$ are given by:\n$y - k = \\pm \\frac{a}{b} (x - h)$\nThe slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm \\frac{a}{b}$.\nFrom the given asymptote $y = 3x$, we see that one slope is $3$. Thus, $\\frac{a}{b} = 3$.\nThe slope of the other asymptote is $-\\frac{a}{b} = -3$.\nThe asymptotes of a hyperbola intersect at the center of the hyperbola.\nSince the asymptote $y = 3x$ passes through the center $(h, k) = (5, k)$, we can substitute the coordinates of the center into the equation of the asymptote to find $k$.\nOnce we find the center $(5, k)$ and the slope of the other asymptote $-3$, we can use the point-slope form to find the equation of the other asymptote.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Asymptotes of hyperbola with vertical transverse axis and center $(h, k)$: $y - k = \\pm \\frac{a}{b} (x - h)$\n- Slopes of asymptotes: $\\pm \\frac{a}{b}$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the center of the hyperbola.**\nSince the foci have the same $x$-coordinate $5$, the $x$-coordinate of the center of the hyperbola is $h = 5$.\nThe center $(5, k)$ lies on both asymptotes. We are given one asymptote $y = 3x$.\nSubstitute the center $(5, k)$ into the equation $y = 3x$:\n$k = 3 \\times 5 = 15$.\nSo the center of the hyperbola is $(5, 15)$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the slope of the other asymptote.**\nThe slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm \\frac{a}{b}$. One asymptote has slope $3$, so $\\frac{a}{b} = 3$.\nThe slope of the other asymptote is $-\\frac{a}{b} = -3$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the equation of the other asymptote.**\nWe know the slope of the other asymptote is $m = -3$, and it passes through the center $(5, 15)$.\nUsing the point-slope form of a line equation $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ with $(x_1, y_1) = (5, 15)$ and $m = -3$:\n$y - 15 = -3(x - 5)$\n$y - 15 = -3x + 15$\n$y = -3x + 15 + 15$\n$y = -3x + 30$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe equation of the other asymptote is $y = -3x + 30$.\nWe check if this asymptote passes through the center $(5, 15)$.\n$y = -3(5) + 30 = -15 + 30 = 15$. Yes, it passes through the center.\nThe slopes of the two asymptotes are $3$ and $-3$, which are opposite, as expected for a hyperbola.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$",
