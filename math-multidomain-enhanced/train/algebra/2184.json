    "problem": "Suppose $a<0$ and $a<b<c$. Which of the following must be true?\n\n$ab < bc$\n$ac<bc$\n$ab< ac$\n$a+b<b+c$\n$c/a <1$\n\nEnter your answer as a list of those options that are always true. For instance, if you think only the first and third are true, enter A, C.",
    "solution": "The generated solution is excellent and provides a clear, step-by-step analysis of each option. It correctly identifies options D and E as always true and options A, B, and C as not always true, with clear explanations and counterexamples.\n\nThe generated solution is already well-structured, logically sound, and thoroughly explained. There are no significant areas for improvement. The use of counterexamples for options A and B is effective in demonstrating that these options are not always true. The algebraic manipulations and sign analysis are accurate and easy to follow. The explanation for option C clearly shows why it's never true, and the explanations for options D and E are concise and correct.\n\nThe final answer correctly identifies D and E as the options that must be true. The generated solution is a robust and well-reasoned answer to the problem.\n\nTherefore, the generated solution is already improved compared to the original solution in terms of clarity, rigor, and completeness.  No further improvements are necessary.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{D, E}$",
