    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n\nSolve the inequality\n\\[\\left| \\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} \\right| > 2.\\]\nThe goal is to find all values of $x$ that satisfy this inequality. The variable $x$ is a real number, and we must consider the domain of the expression, which requires $x \\neq 1$.\n\n## Solution Strategy\n\nWe will solve this inequality by considering the definition of absolute value. The inequality $|a| > b$ is equivalent to $a > b$ or $a < -b$. In our case, $a = \\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1}$ and $b = 2$. We will solve the two resulting inequalities separately and then combine their solutions.\n\nThe two inequalities we need to solve are:\n1. $\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} > 2$\n2. $\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} < -2$\n\nFor each inequality, we will manipulate it algebraically to isolate $x$. We will need to consider the sign of the denominator $(x-1)$ when we multiply or rearrange terms to avoid changing the direction of the inequality. A safer approach is to bring all terms to one side and compare to zero, then analyze the sign of the resulting rational expression.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Case 1: $\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} > 2$**\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to get 0 on the right side:\n\\[\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} - 2 > 0\\]\nCombine the terms on the left side into a single fraction:\n\\[\\frac{2x - 1 - 2(x - 1)}{x - 1} > 0\\]\n\\[\\frac{2x - 1 - 2x + 2}{x - 1} > 0\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{x - 1} > 0\\]\nFor this fraction to be positive, since the numerator is positive (1), the denominator must also be positive:\n\\[x - 1 > 0\\]\n\\[x > 1\\]\nSo, the solution for Case 1 is $x > 1$, which is the interval $(1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Case 2: $\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} < -2$**\n\nAdd 2 to both sides to get 0 on the right side:\n\\[\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} + 2 < 0\\]\nCombine the terms on the left side into a single fraction:\n\\[\\frac{2x - 1 + 2(x - 1)}{x - 1} < 0\\]\n\\[\\frac{2x - 1 + 2x - 2}{x - 1} < 0\\]\n\\[\\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1} < 0\\]\nTo solve this rational inequality, we find the critical points by setting the numerator and the denominator to zero:\nNumerator: $4x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{4}$\nDenominator: $x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\nThese critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: $(-\\infty, \\frac{3}{4})$, $(\\frac{3}{4}, 1)$, and $(1, \\infty)$. We test a value from each interval to determine the sign of $\\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1}$ in each interval.\n\nInterval 1: $x < \\frac{3}{4}$, let $x = 0$. $\\frac{4(0) - 3}{0 - 1} = \\frac{-3}{-1} = 3 > 0$.  So, $\\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1} < 0$ is false in this interval.\nInterval 2: $\\frac{3}{4} < x < 1$, let $x = \\frac{7}{8}$. $\\frac{4(\\frac{7}{8}) - 3}{\\frac{7}{8} - 1} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{2} - 3}{-\\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{-\\frac{1}{8}} = -4 < 0$. So, $\\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1} < 0$ is true in this interval.\nInterval 3: $x > 1$, let $x = 2$. $\\frac{4(2) - 3}{2 - 1} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5 > 0$. So, $\\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1} < 0$ is false in this interval.\n\nThus, the solution for Case 2 is $\\frac{3}{4} < x < 1$, which is the interval $(\\frac{3}{4}, 1)$.\n\n**Combining the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2:**\nThe solution to the original inequality is the union of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2.\nSolution = $(1, \\infty) \\cup (\\frac{3}{4}, 1) = (\\frac{3}{4}, 1) \\cup (1, \\infty)$.\n\n## Final Answer\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{x \\in \\left(\\frac{3}{4}, 1\\right) \\cup (1, \\infty)}$",
