    "solution": "### Problem:\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   Given that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we are asked to find the complex number $a-bi$ such that when squared, it equals $8-6i$.\n   In other words, we are given the equation $(a-bi)^2 = 8-6i$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ (positive integers), and we need to determine the value of $a-bi$.\n\n   Key variables: $a, b$ (positive integers)\n   Constraint: $(a-bi)^2 = 8-6i$\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   To solve this problem, we will expand the expression $(a-bi)^2$ and equate the real and imaginary parts of the expanded expression with the real and imaginary parts of the complex number $8-6i$. This will give us a system of two equations with two variables, $a$ and $b$. We will then solve this system, considering the constraint that $a$ and $b$ must be positive integers.\n\n   Relevant formulas:\n   - Expansion of square of a binomial: $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$\n   - Definition of $i^2 = -1$\n   - Equality of complex numbers: Two complex numbers $z_1 = x_1 + iy_1$ and $z_2 = x_2 + iy_2$ are equal if and only if $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - Expand $(a-bi)^2$:\n     $(a-bi)^2 = a^2 - 2(a)(bi) + (bi)^2$\n     $(a-bi)^2 = a^2 - 2abi + b^2i^2$\n     Since $i^2 = -1$, we have:\n     $(a-bi)^2 = a^2 - 2abi - b^2$\n     $(a-bi)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) + (-2ab)i$\n     $(a-bi)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) - 2abi$\n\n   - Equate the expanded form with the given complex number $8-6i$:\n     $(a^2 - b^2) - 2abi = 8 - 6i$\n\n   - Equate the real and imaginary parts:\n     Real part: $a^2 - b^2 = 8$  (Equation 1)\n     Imaginary part: $-2ab = -6$ (Equation 2)\n\n   - Solve Equation 2 for $ab$:\n     $-2ab = -6$\n     $ab = \\frac{-6}{-2}$\n     $ab = 3$\n\n   - Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $ab = 3$, the possible pairs of $(a, b)$ are the factor pairs of 3, which are $(1, 3)$ and $(3, 1)$.\n\n   - Test each pair in Equation 1:\n     Case 1: $(a, b) = (1, 3)$\n       Substitute $a=1$ and $b=3$ into Equation 1:\n       $a^2 - b^2 = 1^2 - 3^2 = 1 - 9 = -8$\n       Since $-8 \\neq 8$, the pair $(1, 3)$ is not a solution.\n\n     Case 2: $(a, b) = (3, 1)$\n       Substitute $a=3$ and $b=1$ into Equation 1:\n       $a^2 - b^2 = 3^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8$\n       Since $8 = 8$, the pair $(3, 1)$ is a solution.\n\n   - Thus, $a=3$ and $b=1$ is the solution satisfying both equations and the condition that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.\n\n   - Calculate $a-bi$:\n     $a-bi = 3 - 1i = 3-i$\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   To verify, we compute $(3-i)^2$:\n   $(3-i)^2 = (3-i)(3-i) = 3^2 - 3i - 3i + (-i)^2 = 9 - 6i + i^2 = 9 - 6i - 1 = 8 - 6i$.\n   This matches the given condition.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3-i}",
