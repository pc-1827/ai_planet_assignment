    "solution": "### Problem Statement\n1. **Problem Statement**\nGiven a function $f(x)$ that satisfies the functional equation $f(x + f(x)) = 4f(x)$ for all values of $x.$\nWe are also given the initial condition $f(1) = 4.$\nThe objective is to find the value of $f(21).$\n\n2. **Key Variables and Constraints**\n- Function: $f(x)$\n- Functional equation: $f(x + f(x)) = 4f(x)$\n- Initial condition: $f(1) = 4$\n- Target value: $f(21)$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\n- We are given a functional equation and an initial value. We can use the functional equation iteratively to find values of $f(x)$ for different $x.$\n- Starting with the given value $f(1) = 4,$ we can substitute $x = 1$ into the functional equation to find $f(1 + f(1)) = f(1+4) = f(5).$\n- Then we can use the value of $f(5)$ and substitute $x = 5$ into the functional equation to find $f(5 + f(5)) = f(5+16) = f(21).$\n- This approach should directly lead us to the value of $f(21).$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n- **Step 1:** Use the given initial condition $f(1) = 4$ and substitute $x = 1$ into the functional equation $f(x + f(x)) = 4f(x).$\n   \\[f(1 + f(1)) = 4f(1)\\]\n   Substitute $f(1) = 4$ into the equation:\n   \\[f(1 + 4) = 4 \\times 4\\]\n   \\[f(5) = 16\\]\n\n- **Step 2:** Now we have $f(5) = 16.$ Substitute $x = 5$ into the functional equation $f(x + f(x)) = 4f(x).$\n   \\[f(5 + f(5)) = 4f(5)\\]\n   Substitute $f(5) = 16$ into the equation:\n   \\[f(5 + 16) = 4 \\times 16\\]\n   \\[f(21) = 64\\]\n\n- **Step 3:** We have found $f(21) = 64.$ Let's check if this sequence of values is consistent with the functional equation.\n   - We started with $f(1) = 4.$\n   - We calculated $f(5) = 16.$\n   - We calculated $f(21) = 64.$\n   - For $x=1,$ $f(1 + f(1)) = f(1+4) = f(5) = 16,$ and $4f(1) = 4 \\times 4 = 16.$ So $f(1 + f(1)) = 4f(1)$ is satisfied.\n   - For $x=5,$ $f(5 + f(5)) = f(5+16) = f(21) = 64,$ and $4f(5) = 4 \\times 16 = 64.$ So $f(5 + f(5)) = 4f(5)$ is satisfied.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\n- **Final Answer:** The value of $f(21)$ is $64.$\n- **Verification:** We have shown in Step 3 that the derived values are consistent with the given functional equation and initial condition for the steps we took to reach $f(21).$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{64}$",
