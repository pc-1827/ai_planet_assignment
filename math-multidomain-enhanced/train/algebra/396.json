    "problem": "The hyperbola \\[-x^2+2y^2-10x-16y+1=0\\]has two foci. Find the coordinates of either of them. (Enter your answer as an ordered pair. Enter only one of the foci, not both.)",
    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\n- Rewrite the problem in clear terms:\n  Find the coordinates of one of the two foci of the hyperbola given by the equation \\[-x^2+2y^2-10x-16y+1=0\\].\n\n- Highlight key variables and constraints:\n  The equation of the hyperbola is given in general form. We need to convert it to the standard form to identify the center, semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, and then calculate the distance from the center to the foci. We need to return the coordinates of only one focus.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\n- Convert the given equation of the hyperbola to its standard form by completing the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms.\n- Identify the center $(h, k)$, and the values of $a^2$ and $b^2$ from the standard form.\n- Determine if the hyperbola opens horizontally or vertically based on the standard form.\n- Calculate $c$ using the relation $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\n- Find the coordinates of the foci using the center $(h, k)$ and the value of $c$, based on the orientation of the hyperbola.\n- Choose one of the foci and present it as the answer.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Standard form of a vertically opening hyperbola: $\\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1$\n- Standard form of a horizontally opening hyperbola: $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$\n- Relationship between $a, b, c$: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$\n- Foci of a vertically opening hyperbola: $(h, k \\pm c)$\n- Foci of a horizontally opening hyperbola: $(h \\pm c, k)$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n- **Step 1: Rewrite the equation by grouping x and y terms.**\n  \\[(-x^2-10x) + (2y^2-16y) + 1 = 0\\]\n\n- **Step 2: Factor out the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms.**\n  \\[-(x^2+10x) + 2(y^2-8y) + 1 = 0\\]\n\n- **Step 3: Complete the square for the x terms and y terms.**\n  For x terms: $x^2+10x = (x+5)^2 - 25$\n  For y terms: $y^2-8y = (y-4)^2 - 16$\n\n- **Step 4: Substitute the completed square forms back into the equation.**\n  \\[-((x+5)^2 - 25) + 2((y-4)^2 - 16) + 1 = 0\\]\n  \\[-(x+5)^2 + 25 + 2(y-4)^2 - 32 + 1 = 0\\]\n\n- **Step 5: Simplify the equation and rearrange to the standard form.**\n  \\[-(x+5)^2 + 2(y-4)^2 - 6 = 0\\]\n  \\[2(y-4)^2 - (x+5)^2 = 6\\]\n  Divide by 6 to get the standard form:\n  \\[\\frac{2(y-4)^2}{6} - \\frac{(x+5)^2}{6} = 1\\]\n  \\[\\frac{(y-4)^2}{3} - \\frac{(x+5)^2}{6} = 1\\]\n\n- **Step 6: Identify $a^2$, $b^2$, and the center $(h, k)$.**\n  From the standard form $\\frac{(y-4)^2}{3} - \\frac{(x+5)^2}{6} = 1$, we have:\n  $a^2 = 3$, $b^2 = 6$, $h = -5$, $k = 4$.\n  Center is $(h, k) = (-5, 4)$.\n\n- **Step 7: Calculate $c^2$ and $c$.**\n  $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 3 + 6 = 9$\n  $c = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\n- **Step 8: Determine the orientation and find the foci.**\n  Since the term with $(y-4)^2$ is positive, the hyperbola opens vertically.\n  The foci are at $(h, k \\pm c) = (-5, 4 \\pm 3)$.\n  Foci are $(-5, 4+3) = (-5, 7)$ and $(-5, 4-3) = (-5, 1)$.\n\n- **Step 9: Choose one focus.**\n  We can choose either $(-5, 7)$ or $(-5, 1)$. Let's choose $(-5, 7)$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe coordinates of one of the foci are $\\boxed{(-5, 7)}$",
