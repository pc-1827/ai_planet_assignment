    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nThe graphs of the cubic function $y = x^3 - 3x + 2$ and the linear function $x + 4y = 4$ intersect at three points $(x_1,y_1),$ $(x_2,y_2),$ and $(x_3,y_3).$ We are asked to compute the sum of the x-coordinates, $A = x_1 + x_2 + x_3,$ and the sum of the y-coordinates, $B = y_1 + y_2 + y_3,$ and then find the ordered pair $(A,B).$\n\n## Solution Strategy\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two given equations:\n1. $y = x^3 - 3x + 2$\n2. $x + 4y = 4$\n\nWe will use substitution to solve for $x.$ First, we express $y$ in terms of $x$ from the second equation, and then substitute this expression into the first equation. This will result in a cubic equation in $x.$ The roots of this cubic equation will be $x_1, x_2, x_3.$  We can then use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = A.$ Once we have the sum of the x-coordinates, we can find the sum of the y-coordinates using the linear equation $x + 4y = 4.$\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Express $y$ in terms of $x$ from the linear equation:**\n   From the equation $x + 4y = 4,$ we can solve for $y$:\n   $4y = 4 - x$\n   $y = \\frac{4 - x}{4} = 1 - \\frac{x}{4}$\n\n2. **Substitute this expression for $y$ into the cubic equation:**\n   Substitute $y = 1 - \\frac{x}{4}$ into the equation $y = x^3 - 3x + 2$:\n   $1 - \\frac{x}{4} = x^3 - 3x + 2$\n\n3. **Rearrange the equation into a standard cubic form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$:**\n   Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n   $4(1 - \\frac{x}{4}) = 4(x^3 - 3x + 2)$\n   $4 - x = 4x^3 - 12x + 8$\n   Move all terms to one side:\n   $4x^3 - 12x + 8 + x - 4 = 0$\n   $4x^3 + 0x^2 - 11x + 4 = 0$\n   So the cubic equation is $4x^3 - 11x + 4 = 0.$\n\n4. **Apply Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = A$:**\n   For a cubic equation $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0,$ the sum of the roots is given by $-b/a.$ In our equation $4x^3 + 0x^2 - 11x + 4 = 0,$ we have $a = 4,$ $b = 0,$ $c = -11,$ and $d = 4.$\n   Therefore, $A = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{0}{4} = 0.$\n\n5. **Find the sum of the y-coordinates $y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = B$:**\n   We know that for each intersection point $(x_i, y_i),$ the coordinates satisfy the linear equation $x_i + 4y_i = 4,$ or $y_i = 1 - \\frac{x_i}{4}.$\n   Summing these equations for $i = 1, 2, 3,$ we get:\n   $y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = (1 - \\frac{x_1}{4}) + (1 - \\frac{x_2}{4}) + (1 - \\frac{x_3}{4})$\n   $y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 3 - \\frac{1}{4}(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)$\n   We already found $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0,$ so substitute this value:\n   $B = y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 3 - \\frac{1}{4}(0) = 3 - 0 = 3.$\n\n6. **Determine the ordered pair $(A,B)$:**\n   We found $A = 0$ and $B = 3.$ Therefore, the ordered pair is $(A,B) = (0,3).$\n\n## Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(0,3)}$",
