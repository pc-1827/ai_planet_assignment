    "solution": "## Solution\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   - The problem is to find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola defined by the equation $xy = 1$.\n   - Key variables: equation of hyperbola $xy = 1$.\n   - Constraint: Find the distance between the foci.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   - We will transform the given equation $xy = 1$ into the standard form of a hyperbola by rotating the coordinate axes.\n   - The standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin is $\\frac{X^2}{a^2} - \\frac{Y^2}{b^2} = 1$ or $\\frac{Y^2}{a^2} - \\frac{X^2}{b^2} = 1$.\n   - We will find the angle of rotation needed to eliminate the $xy$ term. For a general equation $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the angle of rotation $\\theta$ to eliminate the $xy$ term is given by $\\cot(2\\theta) = \\frac{A-C}{B}$.\n   - After transforming the equation to the standard form, we will identify $a^2$ and $b^2$, and then calculate $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to each focus.\n   - The distance between the foci is $2c$.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - **Step 1: Determine the angle of rotation.**\n     For the equation $xy = 1$, we have $A = 0, B = 1, C = 0$.\n     $\\cot(2\\theta) = \\frac{A-C}{B} = \\frac{0-0}{1} = 0$.\n     This implies $2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 45^\\circ$.\n\n   - **Step 2: Apply the rotation of axes.**\n     The rotation formulas are:\n     $x = X \\cos\\theta - Y \\sin\\theta$\n     $y = X \\sin\\theta + Y \\cos\\theta$\n     For $\\theta = 45^\\circ$, $\\cos\\theta = \\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n     $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(X - Y)$\n     $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(X + Y)$\n\n   - **Step 3: Substitute into the equation $xy = 1$.**\n     $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(X - Y)\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(X + Y)\\right) = 1$\n     $\\frac{1}{2}(X - Y)(X + Y) = 1$\n     $\\frac{1}{2}(X^2 - Y^2) = 1$\n     $X^2 - Y^2 = 2$\n     $\\frac{X^2}{2} - \\frac{Y^2}{2} = 1$\n\n   - **Step 4: Identify $a^2$ and $b^2$ and calculate $c^2$.**\n     The standard form is $\\frac{X^2}{a^2} - \\frac{Y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a^2 = 2$ and $b^2 = 2$.\n     $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n     $c = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n\n   - **Step 5: Calculate the distance between the foci.**\n     The distance between the foci is $2c = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The distance between the foci of the hyperbola $xy=1$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\n**Verification:**\nThe equation $\\frac{X^2}{2} - \\frac{Y^2}{2} = 1$ is a hyperbola centered at the origin with $a = \\sqrt{2}$, $b = \\sqrt{2}$, and $c = 2$. The foci in the XY-coordinate system are at $(\\pm c, 0) = (\\pm 2, 0)$. The distance between these foci is $2c = 4$. Rotating back to the $xy$-coordinate system will not change the distance between the foci, as rotation is a rigid transformation. Thus, the distance between the foci of the hyperbola $xy=1$ is indeed 4.",
