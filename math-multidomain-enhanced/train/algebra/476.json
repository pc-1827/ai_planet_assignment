    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nThe problem describes two sequences of positive integers, an increasing arithmetic sequence and an increasing geometric sequence, both starting with 1. Let $a_n$ be the $n$-th term of the arithmetic sequence and $b_n$ be the $n$-th term of the geometric sequence, both for $n \\ge 1$. We are given that $a_1=1$ and $b_1=1$.\nThe combined sequence $c_n$ is defined as $c_n = a_n + b_n$. We are given that for some integer $k$, $c_{k-1} = 100$ and $c_{k+1} = 1000$. We need to find the value of $c_k$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $a_n = 1 + (n-1)d$ (arithmetic sequence, $d>0$)\n- $b_n = r^{n-1}$ (geometric sequence, $r>1$)\n- $c_n = a_n + b_n = 1 + (n-1)d + r^{n-1}$\n- $c_{k-1} = 100$\n- $c_{k+1} = 1000$\n- Find $c_k$\n\n## Solution Strategy\nWe will use the given conditions for $c_{k-1}$ and $c_{k+1}$ to express them in terms of $d, r, k$. Then we will try to find a relationship that allows us to calculate $c_k$.\nWe will express $c_{k-1}, c_k, c_{k+1}$ using the formulas for $a_n$ and $b_n$. We will then try to eliminate $d$ and $r$ or find a direct relation for $c_k$.\nLet's consider the differences between consecutive terms of $c_n$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Express $c_{k-1}, c_k, c_{k+1}$ in terms of $d, r, k$**:\n   - $c_{k-1} = 1 + (k-1-1)d + r^{k-1-1} = 1 + (k-2)d + r^{k-2} = 100$  (Equation 1)\n   - $c_k = 1 + (k-1)d + r^{k-1}$  (Equation 2)\n   - $c_{k+1} = 1 + (k+1-1)d + r^{k+1-1} = 1 + kd + r^k = 1000$  (Equation 3)\n\n2. **Find the differences between consecutive terms**:\n   - $c_k - c_{k-1} = [1 + (k-1)d + r^{k-1}] - [1 + (k-2)d + r^{k-2}] = d + r^{k-1} - r^{k-2} = d + r^{k-2}(r-1)$\n   - $c_{k+1} - c_k = [1 + kd + r^k] - [1 + (k-1)d + r^{k-1}] = d + r^k - r^{k-1} = d + r^{k-1}(r-1)$\n\n3. **Assume $k=3$ for simplicity and solve the system of equations**:\n   If $k=3$, then:\n   - $c_{k-1} = c_2 = 1 + (2-2)d + r^{2-2} = 1 + 0d + r^0 = 1 + d + r = 100$\n   - $c_{k+1} = c_4 = 1 + (4-2)d + r^{4-2} = 1 + 2d + r^2 = c_3 = 1 + 2d + r^2 = c_k$\n   If $k=3$, then:\n   - $c_{k-1} = c_2 = 1 + (3-2)d + r^{3-2} = 1 + d + r = 100$\n   - $c_{k+1} = c_4 = 1 + (3+1-2)d + r^{3+1-2} = 1 + 2d + r^2 = 1000$\n   This is wrong index substitution. Correct substitution for $k=3$:\n   - $c_{k-1} = c_2 = 1 + (2-2)d + r^{2-2} = 1 + (2-1-1)d + r^{2-1-1} = 1 + 0d + r^0 = 1 + d + r = 100$\n   - $c_{k+1} = c_4 = 1 + (4-1)d + r^{4-1} = 1 + 3d + r^3 = 1000$\n   - $c_k = c_3 = 1 + (3-1)d + r^{3-1} = 1 + 2d + r^2 = c_k$\n\n   From $c_{k-1} = 100$ and $c_{k+1} = 1000$ for $k=3$:\n   - $1 + d + r = 100 \\implies d + r = 99 \\implies d = 99 - r$\n   - $1 + 3d + r^3 = 1000 \\implies 3d + r^3 = 999$\n   Substitute $d = 99 - r$ into the second equation:\n   $3(99 - r) + r^3 = 999$\n   $297 - 3r + r^3 = 999$\n   $r^3 - 3r + 297 - 999 = 0$\n   $r^3 - 3r - 702 = 0$\n   We can test integer values for $r$. We can see if there is an integer root.\n   Let $f(r) = r^3 - 3r - 702$.\n   If $r=9$, $f(9) = 9^3 - 3(9) - 702 = 729 - 27 - 702 = 0$.\n   So $r=9$ is an integer root.\n   Then $d = 99 - r = 99 - 9 = 90$.\n   Now we can calculate $c_k = c_3 = 1 + 2d + r^2 = 1 + 2(90) + 9^2 = 1 + 180 + 81 = 262$.\n\n4. **Verify the solution**:\n   - $r=9 > 1$ and $d=90 > 0$, so sequences are increasing.\n   - $c_{k-1} = c_2 = 1 + d + r = 1 + 90 + 9 = 100$. Correct.\n   - $c_{k+1} = c_4 = 1 + 3d + r^3 = 1 + 3(90) + 9^3 = 1 + 270 + 729 = 1000$. Correct.\n   - $c_k = c_3 = 1 + 2d + r^2 = 1 + 2(90) + 9^2 = 262$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{262}$",
