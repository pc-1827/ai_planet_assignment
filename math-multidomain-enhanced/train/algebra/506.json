    "problem": "In a certain sequence the first term is $a_1=2007$ and the second term is $a_2=2008$.  Furthermore, the values of the remaining terms are chosen so that $a_n+a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}=n$ for all $n\\ge 1$.  Determine $a_{1000}$.",
    "solution": "## Solution\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\n\nThe problem defines a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ with the first two terms $a_1 = 2007$ and $a_2 = 2008$. The subsequent terms are determined by the recurrence relation $a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} = n$ for all integers $n \\ge 1$. We are asked to find the value of the $1000^{th}$ term, $a_{1000}$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- First term: $a_1 = 2007$\n- Second term: $a_2 = 2008$\n- Recurrence relation: $a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} = n$ for $n \\ge 1$\n- Target term: $a_{1000}$\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will first calculate the first few terms of the sequence to identify a pattern. Then, based on the pattern, we will derive a general formula for $a_n$ and use it to calculate $a_{1000}$.  We expect to see a pattern with a period of 3 because the recurrence relation links three consecutive terms.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nWe use the recurrence relation $a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} = n$ to calculate the terms sequentially.\n\nFor $n=1$:\n$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1$\n$2007 + 2008 + a_3 = 1$\n$a_3 = 1 - 2007 - 2008 = 1 - 4015 = -4014$\n\nFor $n=2$:\n$a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2$\n$2008 + (-4014) + a_4 = 2$\n$a_4 = 2 - 2008 + 4014 = 2008$\n\nFor $n=3$:\n$a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3$\n$-4014 + 2008 + a_5 = 3$\n$a_5 = 3 + 4014 - 2008 = 2009$\n\nFor $n=4$:\n$a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 4$\n$2008 + 2009 + a_6 = 4$\n$a_6 = 4 - 2008 - 2009 = 4 - 4017 = -4013$\n\nFor $n=5$:\n$a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 5$\n$2009 + (-4013) + a_7 = 5$\n$a_7 = 5 - 2009 + 4013 = 2009$\n\nFor $n=6$:\n$a_6 + a_7 + a_8 = 6$\n$-4013 + 2009 + a_8 = 6$\n$a_8 = 6 + 4013 - 2009 = 2010$\n\nFor $n=7$:\n$a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 7$\n$2009 + 2010 + a_9 = 7$\n$a_9 = 7 - 2009 - 2010 = 7 - 4019 = -4012$\n\nObserved terms:\n$a_1 = 2007, a_2 = 2008, a_3 = -4014, a_4 = 2008, a_5 = 2009, a_6 = -4013, a_7 = 2009, a_8 = 2010, a_9 = -4012, ...$\n\nWe can see a pattern for terms with indices $1, 4, 7, ...$ (of the form $3k+1$), $2, 5, 8, ...$ (of the form $3k+2$), and $3, 6, 9, ...$ (of the form $3k$).\nFor $k \\ge 0$:\n$a_{3k+1} = 2007 + k$\n$a_{3k+2} = 2008 + k$\n$a_{3k+3} = -4014 + k$\n\nWe want to find $a_{1000}$. We write $1000 = 3k+r$. $1000 = 3 \\times 333 + 1$. So $k = 333$ and $r = 1$.\nUsing the formula for $a_{3k+1}$:\n$a_{1000} = a_{3 \\times 333 + 1} = 2007 + 333 = 2340$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2340}$",
