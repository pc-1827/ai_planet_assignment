    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   Find the distance between the vertices of the hyperbola given by the equation\n   \\[\\frac{x^2}{99} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1.\\]\n   The key variables are the coefficients in the hyperbola equation which define the values of $a^2$ and $b^2$. We need to calculate the distance between the vertices of this hyperbola.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   The given equation is in the standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin and opening along the x-axis: $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$.\n   For this type of hyperbola, the vertices are located at $(\\pm a, 0)$.\n   First, we will identify $a^2$ from the given equation and calculate $a$.\n   Then, we will find the coordinates of the vertices.\n   Finally, we will use the distance formula to calculate the distance between these two vertices.\n   The distance between the vertices $(\\pm a, 0)$ is simply $2a$.\n\n   Relevant formulas:\n   - Standard form of a hyperbola opening along the x-axis: $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$\n   - Vertices of such a hyperbola: $(\\pm a, 0)$\n   - Distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$: $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - Step 1: Identify $a^2$ from the given equation.\n     Comparing the given equation $\\frac{x^2}{99} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1$ with the standard form $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, we have $a^2 = 99$ and $b^2 = 36$.\n\n   - Step 2: Calculate $a$.\n     $a = \\sqrt{99} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 11} = \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{11} = 3\\sqrt{11}$.\n     Since distance must be positive, we take the positive square root.\n\n   - Step 3: Determine the coordinates of the vertices.\n     The vertices are at $(\\pm a, 0) = (\\pm 3\\sqrt{11}, 0)$.\n     Thus, the vertices are $V_1 = (3\\sqrt{11}, 0)$ and $V_2 = (-3\\sqrt{11}, 0)$.\n\n   - Step 4: Calculate the distance between the vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n     Using the distance formula:\n     $d = \\sqrt{(-3\\sqrt{11} - 3\\sqrt{11})^2 + (0 - 0)^2}$\n     $d = \\sqrt{(-6\\sqrt{11})^2 + 0^2}$\n     $d = \\sqrt{(-6\\sqrt{11})^2}$\n     $d = |-6\\sqrt{11}|$\n     $d = 6\\sqrt{11}$\n     Alternatively, the distance between the vertices $(\\pm a, 0)$ is $2a = 2 \\times 3\\sqrt{11} = 6\\sqrt{11}$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The distance between the vertices of the hyperbola is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{11}}$.\n   The answer is a distance, so it is a positive value, which $6\\sqrt{11}$ is. The steps are logically sound and follow the standard procedure for finding the distance between vertices of a hyperbola.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{11}}$",
