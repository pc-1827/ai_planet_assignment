    "solution": "### 1. **Problem Statement**\nThe equation of a hyperbola is given by \\[\\frac{x^2}{100} - \\frac{y^2}{64} = 1.\\]The asymptotes of this hyperbola are given by the equations $y = \\pm mx,$ where $m$ is a positive constant. We need to find the value of $m.$\n\n- Key variables:\n    - Hyperbola equation: $\\frac{x^2}{100} - \\frac{y^2}{64} = 1$\n    - Asymptotes equations: $y = \\pm mx$\n- Constraint: $m > 0$\n\n### 2. **Solution Strategy**\nFor a hyperbola of the form $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,$ the asymptotes are given by the equations $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a} x.$\nWe will identify $a^2$ and $b^2$ from the given equation, calculate $a$ and $b,$ and then find the slope $m = \\frac{b}{a}.$\n\n- Relevant formulas/theorems:\n    - Standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin and opening along the x-axis: $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$\n    - Asymptotes of the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$: $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a} x$\n\n### 3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\nGiven the equation of the hyperbola:\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{100} - \\frac{y^2}{64} = 1\\]\nComparing this equation with the standard form $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,$ we identify:\n\\[a^2 = 100 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b^2 = 64\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides to find $a$ and $b,$ and considering the positive values as $a$ and $b$ represent lengths:\n\\[a = \\sqrt{100} = 10\\]\n\\[b = \\sqrt{64} = 8\\]\nThe equations of the asymptotes are given by $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a} x.$\nSubstituting the values of $a$ and $b$ into the formula for the asymptotes:\n\\[y = \\pm \\frac{8}{10} x\\]\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{8}{10}:$\n\\[\\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4 \\times 2}{5 \\times 2} = \\frac{4}{5}\\]\nSo, the equations of the asymptotes are:\n\\[y = \\pm \\frac{4}{5} x\\]\nThe asymptotes are given in the form $y = \\pm mx.$ Comparing $y = \\pm \\frac{4}{5} x$ with $y = \\pm mx,$ we find that $m = \\frac{4}{5}.$\nSince $\\frac{4}{5} > 0,$ the condition that $m$ is positive is satisfied.\n\n### 4. **Final Answer**\nThe value of $m$ is $\\frac{4}{5}.$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$",
