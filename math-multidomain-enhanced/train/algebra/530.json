    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nRewrite the problem in clear terms and highlight key variables and constraints.\n\n**Problem:**\nGiven that the quadratic polynomial $x^2 + 2x + 5$ is a factor of the quartic polynomial $x^4 + Px^2 + Q,$ where $P$ and $Q$ are constants, determine the value of the sum $P + Q.$\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- $x^2 + 2x + 5$ is a factor of $x^4 + Px^2 + Q$\n- $P$ and $Q$ are constants to be determined\n- We need to find the value of $P + Q$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nExplain your approach and list relevant formulas/theorems.\n\n**Approach:**\nWe will use two methods to solve this problem:\nMethod 1: Using roots of the quadratic factor.\nMethod 2: Using polynomial long division.\n\n**Method 1: Using roots of the quadratic factor**\nIf $x^2 + 2x + 5$ is a factor of $x^4 + Px^2 + Q,$ then the roots of $x^2 + 2x + 5 = 0$ must also be roots of $x^4 + Px^2 + Q = 0.$ We find the roots of $x^2 + 2x + 5 = 0$ using the quadratic formula and substitute them into $x^4 + Px^2 + Q = 0.$ By equating the real and imaginary parts to zero, we can solve for $P$ and $Q.$\n\n**Method 2: Using polynomial long division**\nIf $x^2 + 2x + 5$ is a factor of $x^4 + Px^2 + Q,$ then the remainder when $x^4 + Px^2 + Q$ is divided by $x^2 + 2x + 5$ must be zero. We perform polynomial long division and set the coefficients of the remainder to zero to solve for $P$ and $Q.$\n\n**Relevant Formulas/Theorems:**\n- **Quadratic Formula:** For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0,$ the roots are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$\n- **Factor Theorem:** If a polynomial $g(x)$ is a factor of a polynomial $f(x),$ then the roots of $g(x) = 0$ are also roots of $f(x) = 0.$\n- **Polynomial Long Division:** A method for dividing polynomials similar to long division for numbers.\n- **Complex Number Equality:** For a complex number $a + bi = 0,$ both the real part $a = 0$ and the imaginary part $b = 0.$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Method 1: Using roots of the quadratic factor**\n\n**Step 1:** Find the roots of $x^2 + 2x + 5 = 0.$\nUsing the quadratic formula with $a = 1, b = 2, c = 5$:\n$x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 20}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-16}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 4i}{2} = -1 \\pm 2i.$\nLet $x_1 = -1 + 2i.$\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute $x_1 = -1 + 2i$ into $x^4 + Px^2 + Q = 0.$\nFirst, calculate powers of $x_1$:\n$x_1^2 = (-1 + 2i)^2 = 1 - 4i + 4i^2 = 1 - 4i - 4 = -3 - 4i.$\n$x_1^4 = (x_1^2)^2 = (-3 - 4i)^2 = 9 + 24i + 16i^2 = 9 + 24i - 16 = -7 + 24i.$\nSubstitute into $x^4 + Px^2 + Q = 0$:\n$(-7 + 24i) + P(-3 - 4i) + Q = 0.$\n$(-7 - 3P + Q) + (24 - 4P)i = 0.$\n\n**Step 3:** Equate real and imaginary parts to zero.\nReal part: $-7 - 3P + Q = 0$   (1)\nImaginary part: $24 - 4P = 0$   (2)\n\n**Step 4:** Solve for $P$ and $Q.$\nFrom equation (2): $4P = 24 \\Rightarrow P = 6.$\nSubstitute $P = 6$ into equation (1): $-7 - 3(6) + Q = 0 \\Rightarrow -7 - 18 + Q = 0 \\Rightarrow -25 + Q = 0 \\Rightarrow Q = 25.$\n\n**Method 2: Using polynomial long division**\n\n**Step 1:** Perform polynomial long division of $x^4 + Px^2 + Q$ by $x^2 + 2x + 5.$\n(Refer to the long division shown in the thought process above, which was performed correctly.)\nThe remainder is $(12 - 2P)x + (Q - 5P + 5).$\n\n**Step 2:** Set the remainder coefficients to zero.\nFor $x^2 + 2x + 5$ to be a factor, the remainder must be zero, which means the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term in the remainder must be zero.\nCoefficient of $x$: $12 - 2P = 0$   (1)\nConstant term: $Q - 5P + 5 = 0$   (2)\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for $P$ and $Q.$\nFrom equation (1): $2P = 12 \\Rightarrow P = 6.$\nSubstitute $P = 6$ into equation (2): $Q - 5(6) + 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow Q - 30 + 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow Q - 25 = 0 \\Rightarrow Q = 25.$\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate $P + Q.$\n$P + Q = 6 + 25 = 31.$\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nPresent result in boxed{answer} format and verify the answer.\n\n**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\\boxed{31}$\n\n**Verification:**\nWe verified using polynomial long division in the thought process that when $P=6$ and $Q=25,$ $x^2 + 2x + 5$ is indeed a factor of $x^4 + 6x^2 + 25$ with zero remainder. Both methods yielded the same result, $P+Q = 31.$",
