    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n### 1. Problem Statement\nFind the area of the ellipse defined by the equation $x^2 + 6x + 4y^2 - 8y + 9 = 0.$\n- **Equation:** $x^2 + 6x + 4y^2 - 8y + 9 = 0$\n- **Goal:** Calculate the area of the ellipse represented by this equation.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nTo find the area of the ellipse, we first need to transform the given equation into the standard form of an ellipse equation, which is $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$. Here, $(h, k)$ is the center of the ellipse, and $a$ and $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Complete the square for the $x$ terms and the $y$ terms in the given equation.\n2. Rewrite the equation in the standard form of an ellipse.\n3. Identify the values of $a$ and $b$ from the standard form.\n4. Use the formula for the area of an ellipse, $A = \\pi ab$, to calculate the area.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Complete the square for x and y terms**\nGiven equation: $x^2 + 6x + 4y^2 - 8y + 9 = 0$\n\nGroup the $x$ terms and $y$ terms:\n$(x^2 + 6x) + (4y^2 - 8y) + 9 = 0$\n\nComplete the square for the $x$ terms ($x^2 + 6x$):\n$x^2 + 6x = (x^2 + 6x + 9) - 9 = (x+3)^2 - 9$\n\nComplete the square for the $y$ terms ($4y^2 - 8y$):\n$4y^2 - 8y = 4(y^2 - 2y) = 4(y^2 - 2y + 1 - 1) = 4((y-1)^2 - 1) = 4(y-1)^2 - 4$\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the completed square forms back into the equation**\nSubstitute the completed square forms into the original equation:\n$((x+3)^2 - 9) + (4(y-1)^2 - 4) + 9 = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the equation and convert to standard form**\nSimplify the equation:\n$(x+3)^2 - 9 + 4(y-1)^2 - 4 + 9 = 0$\n$(x+3)^2 + 4(y-1)^2 - 4 = 0$\n$(x+3)^2 + 4(y-1)^2 = 4$\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to get the standard form of the ellipse equation:\n$\\frac{(x+3)^2}{4} + \\frac{4(y-1)^2}{4} = \\frac{4}{4}$\n$\\frac{(x+3)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{1} = 1$\n\nThis is the standard form $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $h = -3$, $k = 1$, $a^2 = 4$, and $b^2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify a and b, and calculate the area**\nFrom $a^2 = 4$, we get $a = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nFrom $b^2 = 1$, we get $b = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\n\nThe area of the ellipse is given by the formula $A = \\pi ab$.\n$A = \\pi (2)(1) = 2\\pi$\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe area of the ellipse is $\\boxed{2\\pi}$.\nThe equation represents an ellipse since $a^2 = 4 > 0$ and $b^2 = 1 > 0$. The steps are logically consistent and the area formula is correctly applied. The answer is a scalar quantity representing area, and it is positive and finite, which is expected for the area of an ellipse.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2\\pi}$",
