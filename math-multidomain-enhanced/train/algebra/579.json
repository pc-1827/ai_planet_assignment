    "solution": "## Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\nA line with a y-intercept at the point $(0,5)$ is given. This line intersects the ellipse defined by the equation $9x^2 + 16y^2 = 144$. We need to determine the set of all possible values for the slope of such a line.\n- **Key Variables:**\n    - Slope of the line: $m$ (unknown)\n    - y-intercept of the line: $(0,5)$\n    - Equation of the ellipse: $9x^2 + 16y^2 = 144$\n- **Constraint:** The line must intersect the ellipse.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nTo find the possible slopes, we will first write the equation of the line in terms of its slope $m$ and y-intercept. Then we will find the condition for the intersection of this line with the given ellipse. This condition will be in terms of the slope $m$. We will use the discriminant of the quadratic equation to determine the condition for intersection.\n\n- **Relevant Formulas/Theorems:**\n    - Equation of a line in slope-intercept form: $y = mx + c$, where $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the y-intercept.\n    - Condition for intersection of a line and a curve: Substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the curve and check for real solutions.\n    - For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the discriminant is $D = b^2 - 4ac$. For real solutions, we require $D \\ge 0$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n- **Step 1: Write the equation of the line.**\n   The y-intercept is given as $(0,5)$, so $c = 5$. Let the slope of the line be $m$. The equation of the line is $y = mx + 5$.\n\n- **Step 2: Substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the ellipse.**\n   Substitute $y = mx + 5$ into $9x^2 + 16y^2 = 144$:\n   $9x^2 + 16(mx + 5)^2 = 144$\n\n- **Step 3: Expand and simplify the equation to form a quadratic equation in $x$.**\n   $9x^2 + 16(m^2x^2 + 10mx + 25) = 144$\n   $9x^2 + 16m^2x^2 + 160mx + 400 = 144$\n   $(9 + 16m^2)x^2 + 160mx + 400 - 144 = 0$\n   $(9 + 16m^2)x^2 + 160mx + 256 = 0$\n\n- **Step 4: Apply the discriminant condition for real roots.**\n   For the line to intersect the ellipse, the quadratic equation must have at least one real solution for $x$. This requires the discriminant $D \\ge 0$.\n   For the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, $D = b^2 - 4ac$.\n   Here, $a = 9 + 16m^2$, $b = 160m$, $c = 256$.\n   $D = (160m)^2 - 4(9 + 16m^2)(256)$\n   $D = 25600m^2 - 1024(9 + 16m^2)$\n   $D = 25600m^2 - 9216 - 16384m^2$\n   $D = (25600 - 16384)m^2 - 9216$\n   $D = 9216m^2 - 9216$\n\n- **Step 5: Solve the inequality $D \\ge 0$ for $m$.**\n   $9216m^2 - 9216 \\ge 0$\n   $9216m^2 \\ge 9216$\n   $m^2 \\ge \\frac{9216}{9216}$\n   $m^2 \\ge 1$\n   This inequality is satisfied if $m \\ge 1$ or $m \\le -1$.\n\n- **Step 6: Express the solution in interval notation.**\n   The possible values for $m$ are $m \\in (-\\infty, -1] \\cup [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nThe possible slopes of the line are all values of $m$ such that $m \\le -1$ or $m \\ge 1$. In interval notation, this is $(-\\infty, -1] \\cup [1, \\infty)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{m \\in (-\\infty, -1] \\cup [1, \\infty)}$",
