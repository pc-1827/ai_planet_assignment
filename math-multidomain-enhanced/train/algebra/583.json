    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven that $60^a = 3$ and $60^b = 5,$ we need to find the value of the expression $12^{(1 - a - b)/(2(1 - b))}.$\nHere, $a$ and $b$ are variables defined by exponential equations with base 60. The goal is to evaluate a power of 12 where the exponent is expressed in terms of $a$ and $b.$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the properties of exponents and logarithms to simplify the expression.\nFirst, we will express 60 in terms of its prime factors and relate it to the given equations.\nThen we will simplify the exponent $(1 - a - b)/(2(1 - b))$ using the given equations.\nFinally, we will substitute the simplified exponent into the expression $12^{(1 - a - b)/(2(1 - b))}$ to find the numerical value.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- $x^m \\cdot x^n = x^{m+n}$\n- $\\frac{x^m}{x^n} = x^{m-n}$\n- $(x^m)^n = x^{mn}$\n- If $x^m = y,$ then $x = y^{1/m}.$\n- If $x = y^z,$ then $\\log x = z \\log y.$\n- $\\log_b x - \\log_b y = \\log_b (x/y)$\n- $\\log_b x + \\log_b y = \\log_b (xy)$\n- $c \\log_b x = \\log_b x^c$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nGiven equations are:\n1. $60^a = 3$\n2. $60^b = 5$\n\nWe want to find the value of $12^{(1 - a - b)/(2(1 - b))}.$\n\nFirst, let's express 60 in terms of its prime factors: $60 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5.$\nUsing the given equations, we can substitute $3 = 60^a$ and $5 = 60^b$ into the prime factorization of 60:\n$60 = 2^2 \\times 60^a \\times 60^b.$\nUsing the property $x^m \\cdot x^n = x^{m+n},$ we have $60 = 2^2 \\times 60^{a+b}.$\nTo isolate the term with base 60, divide both sides by $60^{a+b}:$\n$\\frac{60}{60^{a+b}} = 2^2.$\nUsing the property $\\frac{x^m}{x^n} = x^{m-n},$ we get $60^{1 - (a+b)} = 2^2.$\n$60^{1 - a - b} = 4.$\n\nNow, let's express 12 in terms of 60 and 5 (or $60^b$).\n$12 = \\frac{60}{5}.$\nSince $5 = 60^b,$ we can write $12 = \\frac{60}{60^b}.$\nUsing the property $\\frac{x^m}{x^n} = x^{m-n},$ we get $12 = 60^{1 - b}.$\n\nNow we can substitute $12 = 60^{1 - b}$ into the expression we need to evaluate:\n$12^{(1 - a - b)/(2(1 - b))} = (60^{1 - b})^{(1 - a - b)/(2(1 - b))}.$\nUsing the property $(x^m)^n = x^{mn},$ we have:\n$(60^{1 - b})^{(1 - a - b)/(2(1 - b))} = 60^{(1 - b) \\times \\frac{1 - a - b}{2(1 - b)}}.$\nWe can cancel out the term $(1 - b)$ in the exponent (assuming $1 - b \\neq 0,$ which means $b \\neq 1.$ If $b = 1,$ then $60^1 = 5,$ which is false, so $b \\neq 1$ and $1-b \\neq 0$).\n$60^{(1 - b) \\times \\frac{1 - a - b}{2(1 - b)}} = 60^{(1 - a - b)/2} = (60^{1 - a - b})^{1/2}.$\n\nWe already found that $60^{1 - a - b} = 4.$\nSo, $(60^{1 - a - b})^{1/2} = 4^{1/2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2.$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",
