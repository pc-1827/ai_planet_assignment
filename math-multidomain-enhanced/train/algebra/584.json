    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\n- Given a polynomial $P(x)$.\n- When $P(x)$ is divided by $x-17$, the remainder is $14$.\n- When $P(x)$ is divided by $x-13$, the remainder is $6$.\n- Find the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-13)(x-17)$.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will use the Polynomial Remainder Theorem.\nAccording to the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, if a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by $x-c$, the remainder is $P(c)$.\nFrom the given information, we have:\n1. $P(17) = 14$\n2. $P(13) = 6$\n\nWhen $P(x)$ is divided by a quadratic divisor $(x-13)(x-17)$, the remainder must be of degree at most $1$. Let the remainder be $R(x) = ax + b$.\nThen we can write $P(x) = Q(x)(x-13)(x-17) + R(x) = Q(x)(x-13)(x-17) + ax + b$, where $Q(x)$ is the quotient.\n\nWe will use the conditions $P(17) = 14$ and $P(13) = 6$ to find the coefficients $a$ and $b$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nStep 1: Apply the division algorithm and the Polynomial Remainder Theorem.\nWe can express $P(x)$ in the form $P(x) = Q(x)(x-13)(x-17) + ax + b$.\n\nStep 2: Substitute $x=17$ into the equation.\n$P(17) = Q(17)(17-13)(17-17) + a(17) + b$\n$14 = Q(17)(4)(0) + 17a + b$\n$14 = 17a + b$  (Equation 1)\n\nStep 3: Substitute $x=13$ into the equation.\n$P(13) = Q(13)(13-13)(13-17) + a(13) + b$\n$6 = Q(13)(0)(-4) + 13a + b$\n$6 = 13a + b$  (Equation 2)\n\nStep 4: Solve the system of linear equations (1) and (2).\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n$(17a + b) - (13a + b) = 14 - 6$\n$4a = 8$\n$a = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$\n\nSubstitute $a=2$ into Equation 2:\n$13(2) + b = 6$\n$26 + b = 6$\n$b = 6 - 26 = -20$\n\nStep 5: Write the remainder $R(x) = ax + b$.\n$R(x) = 2x - 20$\n\nStep 6: Verify the remainder with the given conditions.\nWhen $x=17$, $R(17) = 2(17) - 20 = 34 - 20 = 14$.\nWhen $x=13$, $R(13) = 2(13) - 20 = 26 - 20 = 6$.\nThese match the given remainders.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-13)(x-17)$ is $2x-20$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2x-20}$",
