    "solution": "## Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nWe are asked to find a quadratic function that has zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$. This means that the function must equal zero when $x=2$ and when $x=4$. Additionally, the function must take the value $6$ when $x=3$. We need to express the quadratic function in the expanded form $ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- Quadratic function form: $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$\n- Zeroes: $x=2$ and $x=4$, i.e., $f(2)=0$ and $f(4)=0$\n- Value at $x=3$: $f(3) = 6$\n- Required output format: $ax^2 + bx + c$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nSince we are given the zeroes of the quadratic function, it is convenient to use the factored form of a quadratic equation. A quadratic function with zeroes at $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be written as $f(x) = a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$, where $a$ is a non-zero constant.\n\nWe will use the given zeroes $x_1 = 2$ and $x_2 = 4$ to write the function in factored form with an unknown constant $a$. Then, we will use the condition $f(3) = 6$ to solve for $a$. Finally, we will expand the factored form to obtain the quadratic function in the expanded form $ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\n**Relevant Formulas/Theorems:**\n- Factored form of a quadratic function with zeroes $x_1$ and $x_2$: $f(x) = a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$\n- Expanded form of a quadratic function: $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Use the zeroes to write the factored form of the quadratic function.**\nGiven zeroes are $x=2$ and $x=4$. Using the factored form, we can write the quadratic function as:\n$f(x) = a(x-2)(x-4)$\n\n**Step 2: Use the condition $f(3) = 6$ to find the value of $a$.**\nSubstitute $x=3$ into the factored form and set $f(3) = 6$:\n$f(3) = a(3-2)(3-4) = a(1)(-1) = -a$\nWe are given that $f(3) = 6$, so we have:\n$-a = 6$\nSolving for $a$, we get:\n$a = -6$\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the value of $a$ back into the factored form.**\nNow that we have found $a = -6$, we substitute it back into the factored form of the quadratic function:\n$f(x) = -6(x-2)(x-4)$\n\n**Step 4: Expand the factored form to obtain the expanded form $ax^2 + bx + c$.**\nExpand the expression:\n$f(x) = -6(x-2)(x-4)$\n$f(x) = -6(x^2 - 4x - 2x + 8)$\n$f(x) = -6(x^2 - 6x + 8)$\n$f(x) = -6x^2 + (-6)(-6x) + (-6)(8)$\n$f(x) = -6x^2 + 36x - 48$\n\nThus, the quadratic function in expanded form is $f(x) = -6x^2 + 36x - 48$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\n**Verification:**\nLet's check if the function $f(x) = -6x^2 + 36x - 48$ satisfies the given conditions.\n- **Zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$:**\n  $f(2) = -6(2)^2 + 36(2) - 48 = -6(4) + 72 - 48 = -24 + 72 - 48 = 0$\n  $f(4) = -6(4)^2 + 36(4) - 48 = -6(16) + 144 - 48 = -96 + 144 - 48 = 0$\n  So, the zeroes are indeed at $x=2$ and $x=4$.\n\n- **Value at $x=3$ is $6$:**\n  $f(3) = -6(3)^2 + 36(3) - 48 = -6(9) + 108 - 48 = -54 + 108 - 48 = 6$\n  So, the function takes the value $6$ when $x=3$.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. The quadratic function in the expanded form is $-6x^2 + 36x - 48$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{-6x^2 + 36x - 48}$",
