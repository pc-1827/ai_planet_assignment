    "solution": "### 1. **Problem Statement**\n- Find the minimum value of the expression $9^x - 3^x + 1$.\n- The variable is $x$, which is a real number ($x \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\n- We need to find the smallest possible value of the expression for any real value of $x$.\n\n### 2. **Solution Strategy**\n- We will use a substitution to simplify the expression. Let $y = 3^x$.\n- Since $x$ is a real number, $3^x > 0$, so $y > 0$.\n- The expression becomes a quadratic function in terms of $y$.\n- We will find the vertex of this quadratic function, which represents the minimum value since the parabola opens upwards.\n- We will ensure that the vertex occurs at a positive value of $y$, which is consistent with $y = 3^x > 0$.\n- Relevant formula: For a quadratic function $ay^2 + by + c$ ($a>0$), the vertex occurs at $y = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ and the minimum value is at the vertex.\n\n### 3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n- Let $y = 3^x$. Since $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $y > 0$.\n- Substitute $y = 3^x$ into the given expression:\n  $9^x - 3^x + 1 = (3^2)^x - 3^x + 1 = (3^x)^2 - 3^x + 1 = y^2 - y + 1$.\n- Let $g(y) = y^2 - y + 1$. We need to find the minimum value of $g(y)$ for $y > 0$.\n- The function $g(y) = y^2 - y + 1$ is a quadratic function in $y$ with $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$. Since $a = 1 > 0$, the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex represents the minimum value.\n- The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $y_v = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{-1}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Since $y_v = \\frac{1}{2} > 0$, the vertex is within the domain $y > 0$.\n- The minimum value of $g(y)$ occurs at $y = \\frac{1}{2}$ and is given by:\n  $g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{4}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n- To find the value of $x$ that corresponds to this minimum value, we set $3^x = y_v = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n  $3^x = \\frac{1}{2}$\n  $x = \\log_3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\log_3(2^{-1}) = -\\log_3(2)$.\n  Since $x = -\\log_3(2)$ is a real number, the minimum value is indeed achieved for a real number $x$.\n\n### 4. **Final Answer**\nThe minimum value of $9^x - 3^x + 1$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\nVerification: We have shown that the minimum value is achieved at $y = 1/2$, which corresponds to $x = -\\log_3(2)$. Substituting this value back into the original expression gives $9^{-\\log_3(2)} - 3^{-\\log_3(2)} + 1 = (3^2)^{-\\log_3(2)} - 3^{-\\log_3(2)} + 1 = 3^{-2\\log_3(2)} - 3^{-\\log_3(2)} + 1 = 3^{\\log_3(2^{-2})} - 3^{\\log_3(2^{-1})} + 1 = 2^{-2} - 2^{-1} + 1 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{3}{4}$. The minimum value is $\\frac{3}{4}$.",
