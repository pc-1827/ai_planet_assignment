    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n\nFind all values of $x$ that satisfy the compound inequality\n\\[5x - 1 < (x + 1)^2 < 7x - 3.\\]\nWe need to determine the range of values for the variable $x$ that makes both inequalities $5x - 1 < (x + 1)^2$ and $(x + 1)^2 < 7x - 3$ true simultaneously.\n\n## Solution Strategy\nWe will solve the compound inequality by breaking it into two separate inequalities and finding the solution for each. Then, we will find the intersection of the two solution sets to get the final answer.\n\nThe two inequalities are:\n1. $5x - 1 < (x + 1)^2$\n2. $(x + 1)^2 < 7x - 3$\n\nWe will solve each quadratic inequality by rearranging it into the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c > 0$ or $ax^2 + bx + c < 0$, finding the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation, and then determining the intervals where the inequality holds.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Solve the first inequality: $5x - 1 < (x + 1)^2$**\n\nExpand the right side:\n$5x - 1 < x^2 + 2x + 1$\n\nRearrange to bring all terms to one side, making the other side zero:\n$0 < x^2 + 2x + 1 - 5x + 1$\n$0 < x^2 - 3x + 2$\n$x^2 - 3x + 2 > 0$\n\nFactor the quadratic expression:\n$(x - 1)(x - 2) > 0$\n\nFind the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$:\n$x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n$x - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2$\n\nThe parabola $y = x^2 - 3x + 2$ opens upwards (since the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive). The inequality $x^2 - 3x + 2 > 0$ is satisfied when $x$ is outside the roots.\nThus, the solution to the first inequality is $x < 1$ or $x > 2$. In interval notation, this is $(-\\infty, 1) \\cup (2, \\infty)$.\n\n**2. Solve the second inequality: $(x + 1)^2 < 7x - 3$**\n\nExpand the left side:\n$x^2 + 2x + 1 < 7x - 3$\n\nRearrange to bring all terms to one side, making the other side zero:\n$x^2 + 2x + 1 - 7x + 3 < 0$\n$x^2 - 5x + 4 < 0$\n\nFactor the quadratic expression:\n$(x - 1)(x - 4) < 0$\n\nFind the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0$:\n$x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n$x - 4 = 0 \\implies x = 4$\n\nThe parabola $y = x^2 - 5x + 4$ opens upwards (since the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive). The inequality $x^2 - 5x + 4 < 0$ is satisfied when $x$ is between the roots.\nThus, the solution to the second inequality is $1 < x < 4$. In interval notation, this is $(1, 4)$.\n\n**3. Find the intersection of the two solution sets.**\n\nWe need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy both $x \\in (-\\infty, 1) \\cup (2, \\infty)$ and $x \\in (1, 4)$.\nWe need to find the intersection of the intervals $( (-\\infty, 1) \\cup (2, \\infty) )$ and $(1, 4)$.\n\nLet's consider the intersection of each part of the first solution with the second solution:\n$(-\\infty, 1) \\cap (1, 4) = \\emptyset$ (empty set)\n$(2, \\infty) \\cap (1, 4) = (2, 4)$\n\nThe union of these intersections is $\\emptyset \\cup (2, 4) = (2, 4)$.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the compound inequality is $2 < x < 4$.\n\n**4. Verification**\nLet's check a value in the interval $(2, 4)$, say $x = 3$.\n$5x - 1 = 5(3) - 1 = 14$\n$(x + 1)^2 = (3 + 1)^2 = 16$\n$7x - 3 = 7(3) - 3 = 18$\n$14 < 16 < 18$, which is true.\n\nLet's check a value outside the interval, say $x = 0$.\n$5x - 1 = 5(0) - 1 = -1$\n$(x + 1)^2 = (0 + 1)^2 = 1$\n$7x - 3 = 7(0) - 3 = -3$\n$-1 < 1$ but $1 \\not< -3$, so the inequality does not hold.\n\nLet's check $x = 1$.\n$5x - 1 = 5(1) - 1 = 4$\n$(x + 1)^2 = (1 + 1)^2 = 4$\n$7x - 3 = 7(1) - 3 = 4$\n$4 \\not< 4 < 4$, so the inequality does not hold.\n\nLet's check $x = 2$.\n$5x - 1 = 5(2) - 1 = 9$\n$(x + 1)^2 = (2 + 1)^2 = 9$\n$7x - 3 = 7(2) - 3 = 11$\n$9 \\not< 9 < 11$, so the inequality does not hold.\n\nLet's check $x = 4$.\n$5x - 1 = 5(4) - 1 = 19$\n$(x + 1)^2 = (4 + 1)^2 = 25$\n$7x - 3 = 7(4) - 3 = 25$\n$19 < 25$ but $25 \\not< 25$, so the inequality does not hold.\n\n## Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{x \\in (2, 4)}$",
