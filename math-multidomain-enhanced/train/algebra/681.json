    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven a function $f$ with domain $[0,2]$ and range $[0,1]$, we define a new function $g(x) = 1 - f(x + 1).$ We need to find the domain of $g(x)$ in the form $[a,b]$ and the range of $g(x)$ in the form $[c,d]$, and then report the ordered quadruple $(a,b,c,d).$\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Function $f$: domain $[0,2]$, range $[0,1]$.\n- Function $g(x) = 1 - f(x + 1)$.\n- Domain of $g(x)$ is $[a,b]$.\n- Range of $g(x)$ is $[c,d]$.\n- We need to find $(a,b,c,d).$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nTo find the domain of $g(x) = 1 - f(x+1)$, we need to determine the values of $x$ for which the expression is defined. The function $g(x)$ is defined if and only if $f(x+1)$ is defined.  Since the domain of $f$ is $[0,2]$, $f(u)$ is defined if and only if $0 \\le u \\le 2.$  In our case, $u = x+1.$ So we require $0 \\le x+1 \\le 2.$ We can solve this inequality for $x$ to find the domain of $g(x).$\n\nTo find the range of $g(x)$, we use the given range of $f$ and the definition of $g(x).$ We know that for any value $u$ in the domain of $f$, the value $f(u)$ is in the range $[0,1].$  For $g(x)$, we consider $u = x+1.$ Since $x$ is in the domain of $g(x)$, we know that $x+1$ is in the domain of $f.$  Therefore, $0 \\le f(x+1) \\le 1.$  We can then use this inequality to find the range of $g(x) = 1 - f(x+1).$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the domain of $g(x).$**\nThe function $g(x) = 1 - f(x+1)$ is defined if and only if $x+1$ is in the domain of $f.$\nThe domain of $f$ is given as $[0,2].$\nSo, we need $0 \\le x+1 \\le 2.$\nTo find the possible values of $x,$ we subtract 1 from all parts of the inequality:\n$0 - 1 \\le x+1 - 1 \\le 2 - 1$\n$-1 \\le x \\le 1.$\nThus, the domain of $g(x)$ is $[-1, 1].$\nTherefore, $a = -1$ and $b = 1.$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the range of $g(x).$**\nWe know that the range of $f$ is $[0,1].$  This means for any input $u$ in the domain of $f,$ we have $0 \\le f(u) \\le 1.$\nFor $g(x) = 1 - f(x+1),$ let $u = x+1.$  Since $x$ is in the domain of $g(x),$ we know from Step 1 that $-1 \\le x \\le 1,$ so $0 \\le x+1 \\le 2.$  Thus $u = x+1$ is in the domain of $f.$\nTherefore, we have $0 \\le f(x+1) \\le 1.$\nWe want to find the range of $g(x) = 1 - f(x+1).$  We can manipulate the inequality $0 \\le f(x+1) \\le 1$ to find the bounds for $1 - f(x+1).$\nMultiply the inequality by $-1.$ When we multiply by a negative number, we reverse the inequality signs:\n$0 \\cdot (-1) \\ge f(x+1) \\cdot (-1) \\ge 1 \\cdot (-1)$\n$0 \\ge -f(x+1) \\ge -1.$\nWe can rewrite this as $-1 \\le -f(x+1) \\le 0.$\nNow, add 1 to all parts of the inequality:\n$-1 + 1 \\le -f(x+1) + 1 \\le 0 + 1$\n$0 \\le 1 - f(x+1) \\le 1.$\nSince $g(x) = 1 - f(x+1),$ we have $0 \\le g(x) \\le 1.$\nThus, the range of $g(x)$ is $[0, 1].$\nTherefore, $c = 0$ and $d = 1.$\n\n**Step 3: Form the ordered quadruple $(a,b,c,d).$**\nWe found $a = -1,$ $b = 1,$ $c = 0,$ and $d = 1.$\nThe ordered quadruple is $(a,b,c,d) = (-1, 1, 0, 1).$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(-1,1,0,1)}$",
