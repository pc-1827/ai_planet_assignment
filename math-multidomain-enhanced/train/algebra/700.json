    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nGiven a number of the form $a+\\sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are some numbers, we are given two conditions regarding this number and its radical conjugate:\n- The sum of the number and its radical conjugate is $-4$.\n- The product of the number and its radical conjugate is $1$.\n\nWe need to find the value of $a+b$.\n\nKey variables: $a$, $b$.\nConstraints:\n- $(a+\\sqrt{b}) + (a-\\sqrt{b}) = -4$\n- $(a+\\sqrt{b}) \\times (a-\\sqrt{b}) = 1$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nLet the number be $z = a+\\sqrt{b}$. The radical conjugate of $z$ is $\\bar{z} = a-\\sqrt{b}$.\nWe will use the given conditions to form two equations involving $a$ and $b$.\nThen we will solve these equations to find the values of $a$ and $b$, and finally calculate $a+b$.\nWe will use the algebraic identities for the sum and product of conjugates.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nLet the number be $a+\\sqrt{b}$. Its radical conjugate is $a-\\sqrt{b}$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the sum of the number and its radical conjugate is $-4$:\n$$(a+\\sqrt{b}) + (a-\\sqrt{b}) = -4$$\nSimplifying the sum:\n$$a + \\sqrt{b} + a - \\sqrt{b} = -4$$\n$$2a = -4$$\nDividing both sides by 2:\n$$a = \\frac{-4}{2}$$\n$$a = -2$$\n\nThe problem statement also says that the product of the number and its radical conjugate is $1$:\n$$(a+\\sqrt{b}) \\times (a-\\sqrt{b}) = 1$$\nUsing the difference of squares formula $(x+y)(x-y) = x^2 - y^2$, we have:\n$$a^2 - (\\sqrt{b})^2 = 1$$\n$$a^2 - b = 1$$\nWe already found that $a = -2$. Substitute this value into the equation $a^2 - b = 1$:\n$$(-2)^2 - b = 1$$\n$$4 - b = 1$$\nTo solve for $b$, subtract $4$ from both sides or add $b$ and subtract $1$ from both sides:\n$$4 - 1 = b$$\n$$b = 3$$\n\nWe need to find the value of $a+b$. We have $a = -2$ and $b = 3$.\n$$a+b = -2 + 3 = 1$$\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe value of $a+b$ is $1$.\nTo verify our answer, let's plug $a=-2$ and $b=3$ back into the original conditions.\nThe number is $a+\\sqrt{b} = -2+\\sqrt{3}$. Its radical conjugate is $a-\\sqrt{b} = -2-\\sqrt{3}$.\nSum: $(-2+\\sqrt{3}) + (-2-\\sqrt{3}) = -2 + \\sqrt{3} - 2 - \\sqrt{3} = -4$. This condition is satisfied.\nProduct: $(-2+\\sqrt{3}) \\times (-2-\\sqrt{3}) = (-2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1$. This condition is also satisfied.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$",
