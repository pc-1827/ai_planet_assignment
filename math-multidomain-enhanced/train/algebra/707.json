    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nFind all real values of $x$ that satisfy the equation:\n$$x + \\frac{45}{x-4} = -10$$\nThe variable is $x$, and we are looking for real solutions. We need to consider the constraint that the denominator $x-4$ cannot be zero, so $x \\neq 4$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nTo solve this equation, we will first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by $(x-4)$. This will transform the equation into a quadratic equation. Then, we will solve the quadratic equation to find the values of $x$. Finally, we will check if the solutions are valid by substituting them back into the original equation and ensuring that $x \\neq 4$.\n\n**Relevant Formulas/Theorems:**\n-  For a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions can be found using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n-  Alternatively, we can factor the quadratic equation into the form $(x-r_1)(x-r_2) = 0$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate the fraction.**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by $(x-4)$, assuming $x \\neq 4$:\n$$(x-4) \\left( x + \\frac{45}{x-4} \\right) = -10(x-4)$$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equation.**\nDistribute $(x-4)$ on the left side and $-10$ on the right side:\n$$(x-4)x + (x-4) \\frac{45}{x-4} = -10x + 40$$\n$$x(x-4) + 45 = -10x + 40$$\n$$x^2 - 4x + 45 = -10x + 40$$\n\n**Step 3: Rearrange into a quadratic equation.**\nMove all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n$$x^2 - 4x + 10x + 45 - 40 = 0$$\n$$x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0$$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation.**\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to 6. These numbers are 1 and 5.\n$$(x+1)(x+5) = 0$$\nFor the product of two factors to be zero, at least one factor must be zero.\nSo, either $x+1 = 0$ or $x+5 = 0$.\nIf $x+1 = 0$, then $x = -1$.\nIf $x+5 = 0$, then $x = -5$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the solutions.**\nWe need to check if $x=-1$ and $x=-5$ are valid solutions by substituting them back into the original equation and ensuring $x \\neq 4$.\n\nFor $x = -1$:\n$$-1 + \\frac{45}{-1-4} = -1 + \\frac{45}{-5} = -1 - 9 = -10$$\nThis is correct. And $x=-1 \\neq 4$.\n\nFor $x = -5$:\n$$-5 + \\frac{45}{-5-4} = -5 + \\frac{45}{-9} = -5 - 5 = -10$$\nThis is correct. And $x=-5 \\neq 4$.\n\nBoth solutions are valid.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe real values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $-1$ and $-5$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{-1,-5}",
