    "solution": "### Problem Statement\n- **Rewrite the problem in clear terms:**\nWe are given an 8x8 chessboard where each square at row $i$ and column $j$ (both indexed from 0 to 7) is labelled with the number $\\frac{1}{i + 8 - j}$. We need to select eight squares such that exactly one square is chosen from each row and exactly one square is chosen from each column. Our goal is to find the minimum possible sum of the labels of these eight chosen squares.\n\n- **Highlight key variables and constraints:**\n    - Chessboard size: 8x8\n    - Row index: $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$\n    - Column index: $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$\n    - Label of square (i, j): $L_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{i + 8 - j}$\n    - Constraint 1: Exactly one square chosen from each row.\n    - Constraint 2: Exactly one square chosen from each column.\n    - Objective: Minimize the sum of labels of the eight chosen squares.\n\n### Solution Strategy\n- **Approach:**\nWe need to choose a set of 8 squares, one from each row and column, to minimize the sum of their labels. Let's represent the chosen squares by selecting a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$, where for each row $i$, we choose the square in column $\\sigma(i)$. The sum of labels will be $S = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} L_{i, \\sigma(i)} = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\frac{1}{i + 8 - \\sigma(i)}$. To minimize $S$, we need to maximize the denominators $i + 8 - \\sigma(i)$.\n\n- **Relevant formulas/theorems:**\nWe will use the concept of permutations and the properties of fractions to find the minimum sum. We will also use the idea that to minimize the sum of fractions with positive numerators, we need to maximize their denominators. Jensen's inequality can be used to formally justify that making the denominators as equal as possible minimizes the sum of reciprocals given a fixed sum of denominators.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Define the denominator:**\nThe denominator for the square at row $i$ and column $j$ is $D_{i,j} = i + 8 - j$. We want to choose a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{0, 1, ..., 7\\}$ to minimize the sum $S = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\frac{1}{D_{i, \\sigma(i)}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\frac{1}{i + 8 - \\sigma(i)}$.\n\n2. **Consider the sum of denominators:**\nFor any permutation $\\sigma$, the sum of the denominators is $\\sum_{i=0}^{7} D_{i, \\sigma(i)} = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} (i + 8 - \\sigma(i)) = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} i + \\sum_{i=0}^{7} 8 - \\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\sigma(i)$.\nSince $\\sigma$ is a permutation of $\\{0, 1, ..., 7\\}$, $\\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\sigma(i) = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} i = \\frac{7 \\times 8}{2} = 28$.\nAlso, $\\sum_{i=0}^{7} i = 28$ and $\\sum_{i=0}^{7} 8 = 8 \\times 8 = 64$.\nTherefore, $\\sum_{i=0}^{7} D_{i, \\sigma(i)} = 28 + 64 - 28 = 64$.\nThe sum of denominators is constant for any permutation $\\sigma$.\n\n3. **Minimize the sum of reciprocals with a fixed sum of denominators:**\nTo minimize $\\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\frac{1}{D_{i, \\sigma(i)}}$ subject to $\\sum_{i=0}^{7} D_{i, \\sigma(i)} = 64$, we should make the denominators $D_{i, \\sigma(i)}$ as close to each other as possible. The most equal distribution is when all $D_{i, \\sigma(i)}$ are equal to the average, which is $64/8 = 8$.\n\n4. **Find a permutation that makes all denominators equal to 8:**\nWe want to find a permutation $\\sigma$ such that $i + 8 - \\sigma(i) = 8$ for all $i = 0, 1, ..., 7$.\nThis simplifies to $i - \\sigma(i) = 0$, or $\\sigma(i) = i$.\nThe identity permutation $\\sigma(i) = i$ gives $D_{i, i} = i + 8 - i = 8$ for all $i = 0, 1, ..., 7$.\nThis is a valid permutation as each column index $i$ is used exactly once.\n\n5. **Calculate the minimum sum:**\nFor $\\sigma(i) = i$, the sum of labels is $S = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\frac{1}{D_{i, i}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\frac{1}{8} = 8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\n\n6. **Verify minimality:**\nSince the sum of denominators is fixed at 64, and we have achieved the case where all denominators are equal (which intuitively minimizes the sum of reciprocals, and can be formally shown using convexity), the minimum sum is indeed 1.\n\n### Final Answer\n1. **Final Answer:** The final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",
