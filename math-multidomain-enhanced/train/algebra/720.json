    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n\nThe polynomial $P(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6$ has a factor of $Q(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1.$ We need to find the ordered pair $(a,b).$\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- $P(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6$ is a polynomial of degree 4.\n- $Q(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1$ is a factor of $P(x).$\n- We need to find the values of $a$ and $b.$\n\n## Solution Strategy\n\nSince $Q(x)$ is a factor of $P(x),$ there exists a polynomial $R(x)$ such that $P(x) = Q(x)R(x).$\nThe degree of $R(x)$ must be $4 - 2 = 2.$ Let $R(x) = cx^2 + dx + e.$\nThen we can expand the product $Q(x)R(x)$ and compare the coefficients with the polynomial $P(x)$ to determine the values of $a$ and $b.$\n\nAlternatively, we can perform polynomial long division of $P(x)$ by $Q(x)$ and set the remainder to zero. This will give us equations in terms of $a$ and $b$ that we can solve.\n\nWe will use the method of comparing coefficients.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Assume the form of the quotient polynomial:**\n   Let $R(x) = cx^2 + dx + e.$\n   Then $P(x) = Q(x)R(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(cx^2 + dx + e).$\n\n2. **Expand the product $Q(x)R(x):$**\n   $P(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(cx^2 + dx + e)$\n   $P(x) = 3x^2(cx^2 + dx + e) - 2x(cx^2 + dx + e) + 1(cx^2 + dx + e)$\n   $P(x) = 3cx^4 + 3dx^3 + 3ex^2 - 2cx^3 - 2dx^2 - 2ex + cx^2 + dx + e$\n   $P(x) = 3cx^4 + (3d - 2c)x^3 + (3e - 2d + c)x^2 + (d - 2e)x + e$\n\n3. **Compare coefficients with the given polynomial $P(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6:$**\n   By comparing the coefficients of corresponding powers of $x,$ we get the following system of equations:\n   - Coefficient of $x^4$: $3c = a$  (1)\n   - Coefficient of $x^3$: $3d - 2c = b$  (2)\n   - Coefficient of $x^2$: $3e - 2d + c = 32$  (3)\n   - Coefficient of $x$: $d - 2e = -16$  (4)\n   - Constant term: $e = 6$  (5)\n\n4. **Solve the system of equations:**\n   From equation (5), we have $e = 6.$\n   Substitute $e=6$ into equation (4):\n   $d - 2(6) = -16$\n   $d - 12 = -16$\n   $d = -16 + 12 = -4$\n   Substitute $e=6$ and $d=-4$ into equation (3):\n   $3(6) - 2(-4) + c = 32$\n   $18 + 8 + c = 32$\n   $26 + c = 32$\n   $c = 32 - 26 = 6$\n   Substitute $c=6$ into equation (1):\n   $3(6) = a$\n   $a = 18$\n   Substitute $c=6$ and $d=-4$ into equation (2):\n   $3(-4) - 2(6) = b$\n   $-12 - 12 = b$\n   $b = -24$\n\n5. **Ordered pair $(a,b)$:**\n   The ordered pair is $(a,b) = (18, -24).$\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   Let's verify if $(a,b) = (18, -24)$ is correct.\n   If $a = 18$ and $b = -24,$ then $P(x) = 18x^4 - 24x^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6.$\n   With $c=6, d=-4, e=6,$ we have $R(x) = 6x^2 - 4x + 6.$\n   $Q(x)R(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(6x^2 - 4x + 6)$\n   $= 18x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x^3 + 8x^2 - 12x + 6x^2 - 4x + 6$\n   $= 18x^4 - 24x^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6$\n   This is equal to $P(x),$ so our solution is correct.\n\n## Final Answer\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\nThe polynomial $ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6$ has a factor of $3x^2 - 2x + 1.$  Find the ordered pair $(a,b).$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nWe assume that since $3x^2 - 2x + 1$ is a factor of $ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6,$ we can write $ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 = (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(cx^2 + dx + e).$ By expanding the right side and comparing coefficients of corresponding powers of $x$ with the left side, we can form a system of equations to solve for $a$ and $b.$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\nLet $ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 = (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(cx^2 + dx + e).$\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n$3cx^4 + (3d - 2c)x^3 + (3e - 2d + c)x^2 + (d - 2e)x + e.$\nComparing coefficients, we have:\n$3c = a$\n$3d - 2c = b$\n$3e - 2d + c = 32$\n$d - 2e = -16$\n$e = 6$\nSubstituting $e = 6$ into $d - 2e = -16,$ we get $d - 2(6) = -16,$ so $d = -16 + 12 = -4.$\nSubstituting $e = 6$ and $d = -4$ into $3e - 2d + c = 32,$ we get $3(6) - 2(-4) + c = 32,$ so $18 + 8 + c = 32,$ which gives $c = 32 - 26 = 6.$\nSubstituting $c = 6$ into $3c = a,$ we get $a = 3(6) = 18.$\nSubstituting $c = 6$ and $d = -4$ into $3d - 2c = b,$ we get $b = 3(-4) - 2(6) = -12 - 12 = -24.$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nThe ordered pair $(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{(18, -24)}$",
