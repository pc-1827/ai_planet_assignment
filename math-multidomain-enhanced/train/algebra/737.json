Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the equation**\nGiven equation is $(z + 1)^5 = 32z^5$.\nDivide both sides by $z^5$ (assuming $z \\neq 0$, which we verified in the thought process):\n$\\frac{(z + 1)^5}{z^5} = 32$\n$(\\frac{z + 1}{z})^5 = 32$\n\n**Step 2: Introduce a new variable $w$**\nLet $w = \\frac{z + 1}{z}$. Then the equation becomes $w^5 = 32$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for $w$**\n$w^5 = 32 = 2^5 e^{i 2k\\pi}$, where $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\nTaking the fifth root, we get $w = 2 e^{i \\frac{2k\\pi}{5}}$, for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\nThese are the five fifth roots of 32, equally spaced on a circle centered at the origin with radius 2.\nThus, the roots $w$ lie on a circle $|w| = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Express $z$ in terms of $w$**\nFrom $w = \\frac{z + 1}{z}$, we have $wz = z + 1$, so $wz - z = 1$, which gives $z(w - 1) = 1$.\nTherefore, $z = \\frac{1}{w - 1}$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the locus of $w - 1$**\nSince $w$ lies on the circle $|w| = 2$, the set of points $w - 1$ is obtained by shifting the circle $|w| = 2$ by $-1$ in the complex plane.\nIf $w = X + iY$, then $w - 1 = (X - 1) + iY$.\nThe circle $|w| = 2$ is $X^2 + Y^2 = 4$.\nThe shifted circle is $|w - 1| = 2$, which in terms of real and imaginary parts is $(X - 1)^2 + Y^2 = 4$.\nIn terms of complex number $w' = w - 1$, the locus of $w'$ is a circle centered at $-1$ with radius $2$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the locus of $z = \\frac{1}{w - 1}$**\nLet $W = w - 1$. Then $z = \\frac{1}{W}$.\nThe locus of $W$ is a circle centered at $C = -1$ with radius $R = 2$.\nThe circle for $W$ does not pass through the origin because the distance from the center to the origin is $|-1| = 1 < 2 = R$.\nThe inversion $z = 1/W$ maps the circle of $W$ to a circle for $z$.\nThe radius $r$ of the inverted circle is given by $r = \\frac{R}{| |C|^2 - R^2 |}$.\nHere, $C = -1$, $R = 2$, so $|C| = 1$, $|C|^2 = 1$, $R^2 = 4$.\n$|C|^2 - R^2 = 1 - 4 = -3$.\n$| |C|^2 - R^2 | = |-3| = 3$.\nRadius of the circle for $z$ is $r = \\frac{R}{| |C|^2 - R^2 |} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n**Step 7: Final radius**\nThe radius of the circle on which the complex roots lie is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$",
