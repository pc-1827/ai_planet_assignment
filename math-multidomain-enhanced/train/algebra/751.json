    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nThe problem states that we are given a triangle whose side lengths are $\\log_{10}12$, $\\log_{10}75$, and $\\log_{10}n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. We need to find the number of possible integer values for $n$ such that the triangle has a positive area.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Side lengths: $a = \\log_{10}12$, $b = \\log_{10}75$, $c = \\log_{10}n$\n- $n$ is a positive integer.\n- The triangle must have a positive area.\n\n### Solution Strategy\nFor a triangle to have a positive area, the lengths of its sides must satisfy the triangle inequality. The triangle inequality states that for any triangle with sides $a, b, c$, the following conditions must be met:\n1. $a + b > c$\n2. $a + c > b$\n3. $b + c > a$\n\nWe will substitute the given side lengths into these inequalities and solve for $n$. We will use the properties of logarithms to simplify the inequalities and find the range of possible values for $n$. Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we will count the number of integers in the obtained range.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\nLet $a = \\log_{10}12$, $b = \\log_{10}75$, and $c = \\log_{10}n$. Apply the triangle inequality:\n\n1. $a + b > c \\implies \\log_{10}12 + \\log_{10}75 > \\log_{10}n$\n   Using the logarithm property $\\log x + \\log y = \\log (xy)$, we have:\n   $\\log_{10}(12 \\times 75) > \\log_{10}n$\n   Since the logarithm function with base 10 is an increasing function, we can remove the logarithms:\n   $12 \\times 75 > n$\n   $900 > n$\n\n2. $a + c > b \\implies \\log_{10}12 + \\log_{10}n > \\log_{10}75$\n   $\\log_{10}(12 \\times n) > \\log_{10}75$\n   $12 \\times n > 75$\n   $n > \\frac{75}{12}$\n   $n > \\frac{25}{4}$\n   $n > 6.25$\n\n3. $b + c > a \\implies \\log_{10}75 + \\log_{10}n > \\log_{10}12$\n   $\\log_{10}(75 \\times n) > \\log_{10}12$\n   $75 \\times n > 12$\n   $n > \\frac{12}{75}$\n   $n > \\frac{4}{25}$\n   $n > 0.16$\n\nWe have three inequalities for $n$:\n1. $n < 900$\n2. $n > 6.25$\n3. $n > 0.16$\n\nFor all three inequalities to be satisfied, we need to consider the most restrictive lower bound and the upper bound. Comparing $n > 6.25$ and $n > 0.16$, the stronger condition is $n > 6.25$.\nCombining $n > 6.25$ and $n < 900$, we have $6.25 < n < 900$.\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, the smallest integer value for $n$ is 7 and the largest integer value for $n$ is 899.\n\nThe number of possible integer values for $n$ is the number of integers from 7 to 899, inclusive.\nNumber of possible values = $899 - 7 + 1 = 893$.\n\nWe also need to ensure that the side lengths are positive. Since $12 > 1$, $75 > 1$, and for $n > 6.25$, we have $n \\ge 7 > 1$, so $\\log_{10}12 > 0$, $\\log_{10}75 > 0$, and $\\log_{10}n > 0$. Thus, the side lengths are indeed positive.\n\n### Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{893}$",
