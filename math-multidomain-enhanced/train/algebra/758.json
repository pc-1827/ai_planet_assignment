    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nGiven that $a$ and $b$ are integers, and the quadratic polynomial $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of the cubic polynomial $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1.$ We need to find the value of $b.$\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $a, b$ are integers\n- $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1$\n- We need to find the value of $b$\n\n### Solution Strategy\nSince $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1,$ we can use polynomial division or the roots of $x^2 - x - 1 = 0.$\nMethod 1: Polynomial Division.\nIf $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1,$ then the remainder of the division of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1$ by $x^2 - x - 1$ must be zero.\nMethod 2: Roots of the quadratic factor.\nLet $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of $x^2 - x - 1 = 0.$ Since $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1,$ then $r_1$ and $r_2$ must also be roots of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1 = 0.$ We can use these roots to form equations and solve for $a$ and $b.$\nMethod 3: Factorization.\nSince $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1,$ we can write $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1 = (x^2 - x - 1)(cx + d)$ for some constants $c$ and $d.$ By expanding and comparing coefficients, we can find the values of $a$ and $b.$\n\nWe will use Method 3 (Factorization) and Method 1 (Polynomial Division) to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Method 3: Factorization**\nSince $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1,$ we can write\n$$ax^3 + bx^2 + 1 = (x^2 - x - 1)(cx + d)$$\nfor some constants $c$ and $d.$ Expanding the right side, we get\n$$(x^2 - x - 1)(cx + d) = x^2(cx + d) - x(cx + d) - 1(cx + d)$$\n$$= cx^3 + dx^2 - cx^2 - dx - cx - d$$\n$$= cx^3 + (d - c)x^2 + (-c - d)x - d$$\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of $x$ in $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1 = cx^3 + (d - c)x^2 + (-c - d)x - d,$ we have:\nCoefficient of $x^3$: $a = c$   (1)\nCoefficient of $x^2$: $b = d - c$   (2)\nCoefficient of $x$: $0 = -c - d$   (3)\nConstant term: $1 = -d$   (4)\n\nFrom equation (4), we get $d = -1.$\nSubstitute $d = -1$ into equation (3): $0 = -c - (-1) \\implies 0 = -c + 1 \\implies c = 1.$\nSubstitute $c = 1$ into equation (1): $a = 1.$\nSubstitute $d = -1$ and $c = 1$ into equation (2): $b = -1 - 1 = -2.$\n\nThus, $a = 1$ and $b = -2.$ We are asked to find the value of $b.$\n\n**Method 1: Polynomial Division**\nWe divide $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1$ by $x^2 - x - 1.$\n```\n        ax   +(a+b)\n      ________________\nx^2-x-1 | ax^3 +  bx^2 +  0x + 1\n        -(ax^3 -  ax^2 -  ax)\n        ________________\n              (a+b)x^2 + ax + 1\n            -((a+b)x^2 - (a+b)x - (a+b))\n            ________________\n                     (a + (a+b))x + (1 + (a+b))\n                     (2a + b)x + (a + b + 1)\n```\nFor $x^2 - x - 1$ to be a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1,$ the remainder must be zero.\nSo, $(2a + b)x + (a + b + 1) = 0$ for all $x.$\nThis implies that the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term must be zero.\n$2a + b = 0$   (5)\n$a + b + 1 = 0$   (6)\n\nFrom equation (5), $b = -2a.$\nSubstitute $b = -2a$ into equation (6): $a + (-2a) + 1 = 0 \\implies -a + 1 = 0 \\implies a = 1.$\nSubstitute $a = 1$ into equation (5): $2(1) + b = 0 \\implies 2 + b = 0 \\implies b = -2.$\n\nBoth methods give $b = -2.$\n\n**Verification**\nIf $a=1$ and $b=-2,$ then $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1 = x^3 - 2x^2 + 1.$\nWe divide $x^3 - 2x^2 + 1$ by $x^2 - x - 1.$\n$$x^3 - 2x^2 + 1 = (x^2 - x - 1)(x - 1)$$\nSince the division has no remainder, $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $x^3 - 2x^2 + 1.$\n\n### Final Answer\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   - Given that $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1.$ Find the value of $b.$\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   - We use polynomial factorization.\n   - If $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1,$ then $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1 = (x^2 - x - 1)(cx + d)$ for some constants $c$ and $d.$\n   - Expand the right side and compare the coefficients of the powers of $x$ to find $b.$\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - Let $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1 = (x^2 - x - 1)(cx + d).$\n   - Expanding the right side: $(x^2 - x - 1)(cx + d) = cx^3 + (d - c)x^2 + (-c - d)x - d.$\n   - Comparing coefficients:\n     - $x^3$: $a = c$\n     - $x^2$: $b = d - c$\n     - $x$: $0 = -c - d$\n     - Constant: $1 = -d$\n   - From $1 = -d,$ we get $d = -1.$\n   - From $0 = -c - d,$ we get $c = -d = -(-1) = 1.$\n   - From $b = d - c,$ we get $b = -1 - 1 = -2.$\n   - From $a = c,$ we get $a = 1.$\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   - The value of $b$ is $\\boxed{-2}$\n   - Verification: If $b = -2,$ then $ax^3 + bx^2 + 1 = x^3 - 2x^2 + 1 = (x^2 - x - 1)(x - 1).$ So $x^2 - x - 1$ is indeed a factor.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-2}$",
