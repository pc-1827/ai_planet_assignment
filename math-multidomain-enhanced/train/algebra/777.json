    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\n- Rewrite the problem in clear terms:\n  The problem asks us to calculate the fourth power of the complex number $1 + i$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit defined as $i = \\sqrt{-1}$.\n\n- Highlight key variables and constraints:\n  The key variable is the complex number $z = 1 + i$. We need to compute $z^4$. There are no specific constraints mentioned.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\n- Explain your approach:\n  We will use the algebraic method to solve this problem. We will first compute $(1+i)^2$, and then square the result to obtain $(1+i)^4 = ((1+i)^2)^2$. This approach simplifies the calculation compared to direct expansion using the binomial theorem or repeated multiplication of $(1+i)$ four times.\n\n- List relevant formulas/theorems:\n  - The square of a binomial formula: $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\n  - The definition of the imaginary unit: $i^2 = -1$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n- Step 1: Compute $(1+i)^2$.\n  We use the formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ with $a=1$ and $b=i$:\n  $$(1+i)^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(i) + i^2$$\n  $$(1+i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2$$\n\n- Step 2: Substitute $i^2 = -1$.\n  We know that $i^2 = -1$ by definition. Substituting this into the expression:\n  $$(1+i)^2 = 1 + 2i + (-1)$$\n  $$(1+i)^2 = 1 + 2i - 1$$\n\n- Step 3: Simplify the expression for $(1+i)^2$.\n  Combining the real terms:\n  $$(1+i)^2 = (1 - 1) + 2i$$\n  $$(1+i)^2 = 0 + 2i$$\n  $$(1+i)^2 = 2i$$\n\n- Step 4: Compute $(1+i)^4 = ((1+i)^2)^2$.\n  Now we need to square the result from Step 3, which is $(1+i)^2 = 2i$:\n  $$(1+i)^4 = ((1+i)^2)^2 = (2i)^2$$\n\n- Step 5: Expand $(2i)^2$.\n  Using the property $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$:\n  $$(2i)^2 = 2^2 \\cdot i^2$$\n  $$(2i)^2 = 4 \\cdot i^2$$\n\n- Step 6: Substitute $i^2 = -1$ again.\n  Substitute $i^2 = -1$ into the expression:\n  $$(2i)^2 = 4 \\cdot (-1)$$\n  $$(2i)^2 = -4$$\n\n- Step 7: Final result.\n  Therefore, $(1+i)^4 = -4$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\n- Present result in boxed{answer} format:\n  \\boxed{-4}\n\n- Verify the answer satisfies all conditions:\n  We have computed $(1+i)^4$ using algebraic manipulation and the definition of $i$. We can verify this result by expanding $(1+i)^4$ directly:\n  $(1+i)^4 = (1+i)(1+i)(1+i)(1+i) = (1+2i+i^2)(1+2i+i^2) = (1+2i-1)(1+2i-1) = (2i)(2i) = 4i^2 = 4(-1) = -4$.\n  The result is verified.\n\n- Include units if applicable:\n  No units are applicable as this is a computation with complex numbers.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-4}$",
