    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven positive real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z$ such that $xyz = \\frac{2}{3}.$ We want to compute the minimum value of the expression\n\\[x^2 + 6xy + 18y^2 + 12yz + 4z^2.\\]\nKey variables: $x, y, z$\nConstraint: $xyz = \\frac{2}{3}$\nObjective: Minimize $x^2 + 6xy + 18y^2 + 12yz + 4z^2$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nWe rewrite the expression by completing the square to identify a sum of squares form. Then, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers or AM-GM inequality indirectly by setting the squared terms to be equal to minimize their sum, subject to the constraint $xyz = \\frac{2}{3}.$\nWe rewrite the expression as $E = (x+3y)^2 + (3y+2z)^2.$\nTo minimize $E,$ we can try to make the two square terms equal, i.e., $x+3y = 3y+2z,$ which simplifies to $x = 2z.$\nUsing this relation with the constraint $xyz = \\frac{2}{3},$ we can express the expression in terms of a single variable and then minimize it using calculus.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\nWe rewrite the expression as a sum of squares:\n\\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} x^2 + 6xy + 18y^2 + 12yz + 4z^2 &= (x^2 + 6xy + 9y^2) + (9y^2 + 12yz + 4z^2) \\\\ &= (x+3y)^2 + (3y+2z)^2\\end{align*}\nLet $u = x+3y$ and $v = 3y+2z.$ We want to minimize $u^2 + v^2.$\nTo minimize $u^2 + v^2,$ we consider the case when $u = v$ (or as close as possible).\nSetting $u = v,$ we have $x+3y = 3y+2z,$ which implies $x = 2z.$\nSubstitute $x = 2z$ into the constraint $xyz = \\frac{2}{3}:$\n$(2z)yz = \\frac{2}{3} \\implies 2yz^2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\implies yz^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies y = \\frac{1}{3z^2}.$\nNow substitute $x = 2z$ and $y = \\frac{1}{3z^2}$ into the expression $E = (x+3y)^2 + (3y+2z)^2 = 2(x+3y)^2 = 2(2z+3y)^2.$\n$E = 2(2z + 3(\\frac{1}{3z^2}))^2 = 2(2z + \\frac{1}{z^2})^2.$\nLet $f(z) = 2(2z + \\frac{1}{z^2})^2.$ To minimize $f(z),$ we need to minimize $g(z) = 2z + \\frac{1}{z^2}.$\nWe find the derivative of $g(z)$ with respect to $z$ and set it to zero:\n$g'(z) = 2 - \\frac{2}{z^3}.$\nSetting $g'(z) = 0,$ we get $2 - \\frac{2}{z^3} = 0 \\implies 2 = \\frac{2}{z^3} \\implies z^3 = 1 \\implies z = 1.$\nWe check the second derivative to confirm it is a minimum:\n$g''(z) = \\frac{6}{z^4}.$ For $z = 1,$ $g''(1) = 6 > 0,$ so $z=1$ is a local minimum.\nWhen $z = 1,$ we have $x = 2z = 2(1) = 2,$ and $y = \\frac{1}{3z^2} = \\frac{1}{3(1)^2} = \\frac{1}{3}.$\nCheck the constraint: $xyz = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{2}{3}.$ The constraint is satisfied.\nNow compute the minimum value of the expression:\n$E = (x+3y)^2 + (3y+2z)^2 = (2 + 3(\\frac{1}{3}))^2 + (3(\\frac{1}{3}) + 2(1))^2 = (2+1)^2 + (1+2)^2 = 3^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 9 = 18.$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nThe minimum value of the expression is $\\boxed{18}.$\n\nTo verify the answer, we substitute $x=2, y=\\frac{1}{3}, z=1$ into the original expression:\n$x^2 + 6xy + 18y^2 + 12yz + 4z^2 = 2^2 + 6(2)(\\frac{1}{3}) + 18(\\frac{1}{3})^2 + 12(\\frac{1}{3})(1) + 4(1)^2 = 4 + 4 + 18(\\frac{1}{9}) + 4 + 4 = 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 18.$\nThe answer satisfies all conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{18}$",
