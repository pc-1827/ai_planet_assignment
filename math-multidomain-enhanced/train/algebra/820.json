    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nFind the roots of the polynomial equation $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = 0$.\nThe variable is $x$. We need to find all values of $x$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nFirst, factor out the common factor $x$ from the polynomial. This will give us one root immediately, $x=0$, and reduce the problem to finding the roots of a cubic polynomial.\nFor the cubic polynomial, we will use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. Once we find a rational root, we can divide the cubic polynomial by the corresponding linear factor to obtain a quadratic polynomial.\nFinally, we will solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula to find the remaining two roots.\nThe roots from each step will be combined to give the complete set of roots for the original quartic polynomial.\n\nRelevant Formulas/Theorems:\n- **Factoring**: $ax+ay = a(x+y)$\n- **Rational Root Theorem**: If a polynomial $P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$ with integer coefficients has a rational root $\\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers with no common factors other than 1 and $q \\neq 0$, then $p$ must be a divisor of the constant term $a_0$ and $q$ must be a divisor of the leading coefficient $a_n$.\n- **Polynomial Division**: To divide a polynomial by a linear factor.\n- **Quadratic Formula**: For a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the roots are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n**Step 1: Factor out x**\nThe given equation is $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = 0$.\nFactor out $x$: $x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20) = 0$.\nThis implies that one root is $x=0$.\nNow we need to solve the cubic equation $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20 = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Rational Root Theorem to the cubic equation**\nLet $P(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$.\nPossible rational roots are of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ divides 20 and $q$ divides 6.\nDivisors of 20: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 5, \\pm 10, \\pm 20$.\nDivisors of 6: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6$.\nPossible rational roots: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 5, \\pm 10, \\pm 20, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{3}, \\pm \\frac{2}{3}, \\pm \\frac{4}{3}, \\pm \\frac{5}{3}, \\pm \\frac{10}{3}, \\pm \\frac{20}{3}, \\pm \\frac{1}{6}, \\pm \\frac{5}{6}$.\nTest $x = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$P(\\frac{1}{2}) = 6(\\frac{1}{2})^3+19(\\frac{1}{2})^2-51(\\frac{1}{2})+20 = 6(\\frac{1}{8})+19(\\frac{1}{4})-\\frac{51}{2}+20 = \\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{19}{4}-\\frac{102}{4}+\\frac{80}{4} = \\frac{3+19-102+80}{4} = \\frac{0}{4} = 0$.\nSo $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a root.\n\n**Step 3: Polynomial division**\nSince $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a root, $(x - \\frac{1}{2})$ or $(2x - 1)$ is a factor of $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$.\nDivide $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$ by $(2x-1)$.\nUsing polynomial long division (shown in thought process):\n$6x^3+19x^2-51x+20 = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation**\nNow we need to solve $3x^2+11x-20 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=3, b=11, c=-20$.\n$x = \\frac{-11 \\pm \\sqrt{11^2-4(3)(-20)}}{2(3)} = \\frac{-11 \\pm \\sqrt{121+240}}{6} = \\frac{-11 \\pm \\sqrt{361}}{6} = \\frac{-11 \\pm 19}{6}$.\nTwo roots are:\n$x_1 = \\frac{-11+19}{6} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n$x_2 = \\frac{-11-19}{6} = \\frac{-30}{6} = -5$\n\n**Step 5: Collect all roots**\nThe roots are $x=0$ (from Step 1), $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ (from Step 2), $x=\\frac{4}{3}$ and $x=-5$ (from Step 4).\nThe roots are $0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5$.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe roots of the equation $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = 0$ are $-5, 0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}$.\nWe verify these roots by substituting them back into the original equation (verified in thought process).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{-5, 0, 1/2, 4/3}",
