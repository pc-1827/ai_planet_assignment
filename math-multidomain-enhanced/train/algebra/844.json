    "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nFind two positive real numbers such that their geometric mean is $\\sqrt{3}$ and their harmonic mean is $\\frac{3}{2}.$\nLet the two positive real numbers be $a$ and $b.$\nGiven:\n- Geometric mean (GM) = $\\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{3}$\n- Harmonic mean (HM) = $\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will use the definitions of geometric mean and harmonic mean to set up a system of equations. Then we will solve this system to find the values of $a$ and $b.$\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Geometric mean of two numbers $a$ and $b$: $\\sqrt{ab}$\n- Harmonic mean of two numbers $a$ and $b$: $\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}} = \\frac{2ab}{a+b}$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nLet $a$ and $b$ be the two positive real numbers.\nFrom the given geometric mean, we have:\n$\\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{3}$\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n$ab = (\\sqrt{3})^2$\n$ab = 3$  (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the given harmonic mean, we have:\n$\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}} = \\frac{3}{2}$\nSimplify the harmonic mean expression:\n$\\frac{2}{\\frac{a+b}{ab}} = \\frac{2ab}{a+b} = \\frac{3}{2}$\nSubstitute $ab = 3$ from Equation 1 into the harmonic mean equation:\n$\\frac{2(3)}{a+b} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n$\\frac{6}{a+b} = \\frac{3}{2}$\nMultiply both sides by $2(a+b)$ to eliminate the denominators:\n$6 \\times 2 = 3 \\times (a+b)$\n$12 = 3(a+b)$\nDivide both sides by 3:\n$4 = a+b$  (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1) $ab = 3$\n2) $a+b = 4$\nFrom Equation 2, we can express $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = 4-a.$\nSubstitute this expression for $b$ into Equation 1:\n$a(4-a) = 3$\n$4a - a^2 = 3$\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n$a^2 - 4a + 3 = 0$\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n$(a-1)(a-3) = 0$\nThe possible values for $a$ are $a=1$ or $a=3.$\n\nCase 1: $a=1$\nUsing Equation 2, $b = 4-a = 4-1 = 3.$\nSo, the pair of numbers is $(1, 3).$\n\nCase 2: $a=3$\nUsing Equation 2, $b = 4-a = 4-3 = 1.$\nSo, the pair of numbers is $(3, 1).$\n\nIn both cases, the two numbers are 1 and 3.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nTo verify, we check the geometric and harmonic means for the numbers 1 and 3.\nGeometric mean: $\\sqrt{1 \\times 3} = \\sqrt{3}.$\nHarmonic mean: $\\frac{2 \\times 1 \\times 3}{1+3} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}.$\nBoth conditions are satisfied.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1,3}$",
