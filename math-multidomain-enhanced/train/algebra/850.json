    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n### 1. Problem Statement\n- **Rewrite the problem in clear terms:**\n  We are given a parabola defined by the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$. We know that the vertex of this parabola is at the point $(p,p)$, and the $y$-intercept is at the point $(0,-p)$. We are also given that $p$ is not equal to zero. Our goal is to find the value of the coefficient $b$.\n\n- **Highlight key variables and constraints:**\n  - Parabola equation: $y=ax^2+bx+c$\n  - Vertex: $(p,p)$\n  - $y$-intercept: $(0,-p)$\n  - Constraint: $p \\ne 0$\n  - Target variable: $b$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\n- **Approach:**\n  We will use the properties of a parabola's vertex and $y$-intercept to set up a system of equations involving $a$, $b$, $c$, and $p$. Then we will solve this system to find the value of $b$.\n- **Relevant formulas/theorems:**\n    - The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $x_v = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n    - The $y$-intercept of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is found by setting $x=0$, which gives $y = c$.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n- **Step 1: Use the vertex information.**\n  The vertex is given as $(p,p)$. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $p$, and the $y$-coordinate is also $p$.\n  Using the vertex formula, we have:\n  $p = -\\frac{b}{2a}$  (Equation 1)\n\n  Since the vertex $(p,p)$ lies on the parabola, we can substitute $x=p$ and $y=p$ into the parabola equation:\n  $p = a(p)^2 + b(p) + c$\n  $p = ap^2 + bp + c$  (Equation 2)\n\n- **Step 2: Use the $y$-intercept information.**\n  The $y$-intercept is given as $(0,-p)$. This means when $x=0$, $y=-p$. Substituting $x=0$ and $y=-p$ into the parabola equation:\n  $-p = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c$\n  $-p = c$  (Equation 3)\n\n- **Step 3: Substitute $c$ from Equation 3 into Equation 2.**\n  Substitute $c = -p$ into Equation 2:\n  $p = ap^2 + bp + (-p)$\n  $p = ap^2 + bp - p$\n\n- **Step 4: Simplify the equation and solve for a relationship between $a$ and $b$.**\n  Add $p$ to both sides of the equation:\n  $2p = ap^2 + bp$\n  Since $p \\ne 0$, we can divide both sides by $p$:\n  $2 = ap + b$  (Equation 4)\n\n- **Step 5: Solve for $a$ from Equation 1 and substitute it into Equation 4.**\n  From Equation 1, $p = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. Solve for $a$:\n  $2ap = -b$\n  $a = -\\frac{b}{2p}$  (Equation 5)\n\n  Substitute $a = -\\frac{b}{2p}$ from Equation 5 into Equation 4:\n  $2 = (-\\frac{b}{2p})p + b$\n  $2 = -\\frac{b}{2} + b$\n\n- **Step 6: Solve for $b$.**\n  $2 = \\frac{b}{2}$\n  Multiply both sides by 2:\n  $b = 4$\n\n### 4. Final Answer\n- **Result:**\n  The value of $b$ is 4.\n\n- **Verification:**\n  Let's verify if $b=4$ satisfies all conditions.\n  If $b=4$, then from Equation 5, $a = -\\frac{4}{2p} = -\\frac{2}{p}$.\n  From Equation 3, $c = -p$.\n  So the parabola is $y = -\\frac{2}{p}x^2 + 4x - p$.\n\n  Vertex $x$-coordinate: $x_v = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{4}{2(-\\frac{2}{p})} = -\\frac{4}{-\\frac{4}{p}} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{p}{4} = p$.\n  Vertex $y$-coordinate: $y_v = -\\frac{2}{p}(p)^2 + 4(p) - p = -2p + 4p - p = p$.\n  Vertex is $(p,p)$.\n\n  $y$-intercept (when $x=0$): $y = -\\frac{2}{p}(0)^2 + 4(0) - p = -p$.\n  $y$-intercept is $(0,-p)$.\n\n  All conditions are satisfied.\n\n- **Final Answer in required format:**\n  \\boxed{4}",
