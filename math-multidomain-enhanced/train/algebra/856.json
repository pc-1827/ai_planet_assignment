    "solution": "### Problem Statement\nThe problem asks us to calculate the length of the tangent segment from the origin $(0,0)$ to a circle that passes through the points $(3,4),$ $(6,8),$ and $(5,13).$\n\n- **Given points on the circle:** $A = (3,4),$ $B = (6,8),$ $C = (5,13).$\n- **Point from which tangent is drawn:** Origin $O = (0,0).$\n- **Required:** Length of the tangent segment from $O$ to the circle.\n\n### Solution Strategy\nWe will use the concept of the power of a point with respect to a circle. For a point outside a circle, the square of the length of the tangent from the point to the circle is equal to the power of the point. If a secant from an external point $P$ intersects the circle at points $X$ and $Y,$ then the power of point $P$ is $PX \\times PY.$ In our case, the origin $O$ is outside the circle (we will verify this implicitly). Since points $A=(3,4)$ and $B=(6,8)$ are on the circle and the origin $O=(0,0)$ is collinear with $A$ and $B$ (because $\\vec{OB} = 2 \\vec{OA}$), the line passing through $O, A, B$ is a secant to the circle. Thus, the power of the origin with respect to the circle is $OA \\times OB.$ The length of the tangent from the origin will be the square root of this power.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Distance formula: $d = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$\n- Power of a point $O$ with respect to a circle passing through points $A$ and $B$ on a secant line from $O$ is $OA \\times OB.$\n- Length of tangent from origin is $\\sqrt{Power\\ of\\ Origin}.$\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Calculate the distance from the origin to points A and B.**\n   - $OA = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (4-0)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5.$\n   - $OB = \\sqrt{(6-0)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10.$\n\n2. **Calculate the power of the origin with respect to the circle.**\n   Since the origin $O,$ point $A,$ and point $B$ are collinear and lie on a secant line to the circle, the power of the origin is the product of the distances $OA$ and $OB.$\n   Power of origin $= OA \\times OB = 5 \\times 10 = 50.$\n\n3. **Calculate the length of the tangent from the origin.**\n   The length of the tangent from the origin to the circle is the square root of the power of the origin.\n   Length of tangent $= \\sqrt{Power\\ of\\ origin} = \\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 5\\sqrt{2}.$\n\n4. **Verify that the origin is outside the circle (optional but good practice).**\n   We found that the power of the origin is 50, which is positive. A positive power means the point is outside the circle. Alternatively, we can check if the center is calculated and the distance from the origin to the center is greater than the radius. We have already calculated the center as $(-g, -f) = (5.7, 5.1)$ and $r^2 = 8.5.$ Distance from origin to center squared is $h^2+k^2 = 58.5 > r^2 = 8.5.$ So origin is indeed outside the circle.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe length of the segment tangent from the origin to the circle is $\\boxed{5\\sqrt{2}}$",
