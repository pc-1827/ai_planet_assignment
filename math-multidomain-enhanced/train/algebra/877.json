Problem Statement**\n\nDetermine the values of the constant $c$ for which the function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{x^2+x-20}$ has exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Function: $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{x^2+x-20}$\n- Constant: $c$\n- Condition: Exactly one vertical asymptote\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nA vertical asymptote of a rational function occurs at values of $x$ where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero. To have exactly one vertical asymptote, we need one of the roots of the denominator to also be a root of the numerator, while the other root of the denominator is not a root of the numerator.\n\nSteps:\n1. Find the roots of the denominator $x^2+x-20=0$.\n2. For each root of the denominator, set the numerator $x^2-x+c=0$ and solve for $c$.\n3. Check if for each value of $c$ found, the numerator is non-zero at the other root of the denominator.\n4. List all possible values of $c$ that satisfy the condition of exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Find the roots of the denominator.**\nSet the denominator equal to zero:\n$x^2+x-20 = 0$\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n$(x+5)(x-4) = 0$\nThe roots of the denominator are $x = -5$ and $x = 4$.\n\n**Step 2: Set the numerator to zero at each root of the denominator and solve for $c$.**\n\nCase 1: Numerator is zero at $x = 4$.\nSubstitute $x = 4$ into the numerator $x^2-x+c$ and set it to zero:\n$(4)^2 - (4) + c = 0$\n$16 - 4 + c = 0$\n$12 + c = 0$\n$c = -12$\n\nCase 2: Numerator is zero at $x = -5$.\nSubstitute $x = -5$ into the numerator $x^2-x+c$ and set it to zero:\n$(-5)^2 - (-5) + c = 0$\n$25 + 5 + c = 0$\n$30 + c = 0$\n$c = -30$\n\n**Step 3: Check if for each value of $c$, the numerator is non-zero at the other root of the denominator.**\n\nFor $c = -12$:\nNumerator is $x^2-x-12 = (x-4)(x+3)$.\nDenominator is $x^2+x-20 = (x-4)(x+5)$.\n$f(x) = \\frac{(x-4)(x+3)}{(x-4)(x+5)} = \\frac{x+3}{x+5}$ for $x \\neq 4$.\nIn this case, the factor $(x-4)$ cancels out, creating a hole at $x=4$. The vertical asymptote occurs where the simplified denominator is zero, which is $x+5=0$, so $x=-5$. There is exactly one vertical asymptote at $x=-5$.\n\nFor $c = -30$:\nNumerator is $x^2-x-30 = (x-6)(x+5)$.\nDenominator is $x^2+x-20 = (x-4)(x+5)$.\n$f(x) = \\frac{(x-6)(x+5)}{(x-4)(x+5)} = \\frac{x-6}{x-4}$ for $x \\neq -5$.\nIn this case, the factor $(x+5)$ cancels out, creating a hole at $x=-5$. The vertical asymptote occurs where the simplified denominator is zero, which is $x-4=0$, so $x=4$. There is exactly one vertical asymptote at $x=4$.\n\n**Step 4: List all possible values of $c$.**\nThe values of $c$ for which the function has exactly one vertical asymptote are $c = -12$ and $c = -30$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-12, -30}$",
