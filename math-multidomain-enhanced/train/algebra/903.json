    "solution": "## Problem Statement\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   The foci of the ellipse given by the equation $\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ and the foci of the hyperbola given by the equation $\\frac{x^2}{144} - \\frac{y^2}{81} = \\frac{1}{25}$ are coincident. We need to find the value of $b^2$.\n\n   - Key variables:\n     - Ellipse: semi-major axis squared $a_e^2 = 16$, semi-minor axis squared $b_e^2 = b^2$.\n     - Hyperbola: parameters related to $a_h^2 = 144$, $c_h^2 = 81$, and the equation is scaled by $\\frac{1}{25}$.\n   - Constraint: Foci of the ellipse and the hyperbola are the same.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n   - Find the distance from the center to the foci of the ellipse, denoted as $c_e$, in terms of $b^2$.\n   - Find the distance from the center to the foci of the hyperbola, denoted as $c_h$.\n   - Since the foci coincide, we set $c_e = c_h$ and solve for $b^2$.\n   - We will use the standard formulas for the foci of an ellipse and a hyperbola centered at the origin.\n\n   - Relevant formulas:\n     - For an ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{c^2} = 1$ with $a^2 > c^2$, the distance from the center to each focus is $\\sqrt{a^2 - c^2}$.\n     - For a hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{c^2} = 1$, the distance from the center to each focus is $\\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}$.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   - **Step 1: Find the foci of the ellipse.**\n     The equation of the ellipse is $\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$. Here $a_e^2 = 16$. Assuming $16 > b^2$ (for the major axis to be along the x-axis), the distance from the center to each focus of the ellipse, $c_e$, is given by\n     \\[c_e = \\sqrt{a_e^2 - b^2} = \\sqrt{16 - b^2}.\\]\n     The foci of the ellipse are $(\\pm \\sqrt{16 - b^2}, 0)$.\n\n   - **Step 2: Find the foci of the hyperbola.**\n     The equation of the hyperbola is $\\frac{x^2}{144} - \\frac{y^2}{81} = \\frac{1}{25}$. To write it in standard form, we multiply both sides by 25:\n     \\[\\frac{25x^2}{144} - \\frac{25y^2}{81} = 1\\]\n     This can be rewritten as\n     \\[\\frac{x^2}{144/25} - \\frac{y^2}{81/25} = 1.\\]\n     For this hyperbola, $a_h^2 = \\frac{144}{25}$ and $c_h^2 = \\frac{81}{25}$. The distance from the center to each focus of the hyperbola, $c_h$, is given by\n     \\[c_h = \\sqrt{a_h^2 + c_h^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{81}{25}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{144 + 81}{25}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{25}} = \\sqrt{9} = 3.\\]\n     The foci of the hyperbola are $(\\pm 3, 0)$.\n\n   - **Step 3: Equate the distances to the foci and solve for $b^2$.**\n     Since the foci of the ellipse and the hyperbola coincide, we must have $c_e = c_h$.\n     \\[\\sqrt{16 - b^2} = 3.\\]\n     Squaring both sides, we get\n     \\[16 - b^2 = 3^2 = 9.\\]\n     Solving for $b^2$:\n     \\[b^2 = 16 - 9 = 7.\\]\n\n   - **Step 4: Verify the condition $16 > b^2$.**\n     Since $b^2 = 7$, we have $16 > 7$, which is true. Therefore, our initial assumption was correct.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The value of $b^2$ is $7$.\n\n   - Final Answer: $\\boxed{7}$",
