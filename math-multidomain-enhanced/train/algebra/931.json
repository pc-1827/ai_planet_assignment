    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n### 1. Problem Statement\n- **Rewrite the problem:** Find the smallest possible value of $z$ in the equation $w^3+x^3+y^3=z^3$, given that $w^3, x^3, y^3, z^3$ are distinct, consecutive positive perfect cubes in ascending order.\n- **Key variables:** $w, x, y, z$ are positive integers.\n- **Constraints:**\n    - $w^3, x^3, y^3, z^3$ are consecutive perfect cubes.\n    - $w^3 < x^3 < y^3 < z^3$ (ascending order and distinctness).\n    - $w^3+x^3+y^3=z^3$.\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\n- Let the first of the consecutive positive perfect cubes be $n^3$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\n- Since there are four consecutive perfect cubes in ascending order, they must be $n^3, (n+1)^3, (n+2)^3, (n+3)^3$.\n- Given that $w^3, x^3, y^3, z^3$ are these four consecutive cubes in ascending order, we assign them as follows: $w^3 = n^3$, $x^3 = (n+1)^3$, $y^3 = (n+2)^3$, $z^3 = (n+3)^3$.\n- Substitute these expressions into the equation $w^3+x^3+y^3=z^3$ and solve for $n$.\n- Once we find $n$, we can determine $z = n+3$.\n- We need to find the smallest possible value of $z$, which corresponds to the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the equation.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\n- **Step 1:** Express the consecutive cubes in terms of $n$.\n   Let the four consecutive positive perfect cubes be $n^3, (n+1)^3, (n+2)^3, (n+3)^3$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\n   Since they are listed in ascending order and are represented by $w^3, x^3, y^3, z^3$, we have:\n   $w^3 = n^3$\n   $x^3 = (n+1)^3$\n   $y^3 = (n+2)^3$\n   $z^3 = (n+3)^3$\n\n- **Step 2:** Substitute these into the given equation $w^3+x^3+y^3=z^3$.\n   $n^3 + (n+1)^3 + (n+2)^3 = (n+3)^3$\n\n- **Step 3:** Expand and simplify the equation.\n   $n^3 + (n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1) + (n^3 + 6n^2 + 12n + 8) = (n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 27)$\n   $3n^3 + 9n^2 + 15n + 9 = n^3 + 9n^2 + 27n + 27$\n\n- **Step 4:** Rearrange the equation to find a polynomial equation in $n$.\n   $3n^3 - n^3 + 9n^2 - 9n^2 + 15n - 27n + 9 - 27 = 0$\n   $2n^3 - 12n - 18 = 0$\n   Divide by 2:\n   $n^3 - 6n - 9 = 0$\n\n- **Step 5:** Find integer roots of the cubic equation.\n   We test integer divisors of $-9$: $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 9$.\n   For $n=3$: $3^3 - 6(3) - 9 = 27 - 18 - 9 = 0$. So $n=3$ is a root.\n\n- **Step 6:** Check if there are other positive integer roots.\n   Divide $n^3 - 6n - 9$ by $(n-3)$ using polynomial division or synthetic division.\n   $(n^3 - 6n - 9) \\div (n-3) = n^2 + 3n + 3$\n   So, $n^3 - 6n - 9 = (n-3)(n^2 + 3n + 3) = 0$.\n   The quadratic factor $n^2 + 3n + 3 = 0$ has discriminant $\\Delta = 3^2 - 4(1)(3) = 9 - 12 = -3 < 0$.\n   Thus, the quadratic equation has no real roots.\n   Therefore, $n=3$ is the only real root, and it is a positive integer.\n\n- **Step 7:** Calculate the value of $z$.\n   Since $z = n+3$, and $n=3$, we have $z = 3+3 = 6$.\n\n- **Step 8:** Verify the solution.\n   For $n=3$, the consecutive cubes are $3^3=27$, $4^3=64$, $5^3=125$, $6^3=216$.\n   Let $w^3=27$, $x^3=64$, $y^3=125$, $z^3=216$.\n   $w^3+x^3+y^3 = 27+64+125 = 216 = z^3$.\n   The cubes are distinct, consecutive, positive, and in ascending order.\n   The value of $z$ is 6.\n\n### 4.
