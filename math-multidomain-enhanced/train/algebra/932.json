    "solution": "## Solution\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\n\nFind the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial equation $9x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 15 = 0$, where $a_3, a_2, a_1$ are integer coefficients.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Polynomial equation: $9x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 15 = 0$\n- Coefficients $a_3, a_2, a_1$ are integers.\n- Leading coefficient is 9.\n- Constant term is 15.\n- We need to find the number of different possible *rational* roots.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the Rational Root Theorem to determine the possible rational roots of the polynomial. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial with integer coefficients $c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + c_1 x + c_0 = 0$ has a rational root $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., $p/q$ is in lowest terms), then $p$ must be a divisor of the constant term $c_0$ and $q$ must be a divisor of the leading coefficient $c_n$.\n\nFor our polynomial, $c_4 = 9$ and $c_0 = 15$.\n- Possible values for $p$ are divisors of 15.\n- Possible values for $q$ are divisors of 9.\n\nWe will find all divisors of 15 and 9, and then form all possible fractions $p/q$. Finally, we count the number of distinct rational roots.\n\nRelevant Theorem:\n- **Rational Root Theorem**: If a polynomial $c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + c_1 x + c_0$ with integer coefficients has a rational root $p/q$ in lowest terms, then $p$ divides $c_0$ and $q$ divides $c_n$.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Identify the divisors of the constant term and the leading coefficient.\n- Constant term $c_0 = 15$. Divisors of 15 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15$.\n- Leading coefficient $c_4 = 9$. Divisors of 9 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 9$.\n\nStep 2: List all possible rational roots $p/q$.\nWe consider all combinations of $p$ (divisor of 15) and $q$ (divisor of 9). We can consider positive divisors first and then include both positive and negative signs.\nPositive divisors of 15: $\\{1, 3, 5, 15\\}$.\nPositive divisors of 9: $\\{1, 3, 9\\}$.\n\nPossible positive rational roots $p/q$:\n- For $p=1$: $\\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{9}$  (which are $1, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{9}$)\n- For $p=3$: $\\frac{3}{1}, \\frac{3}{3}, \\frac{3}{9}$  (which are $3, 1, \\frac{1}{3}$)\n- For $p=5$: $\\frac{5}{1}, \\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{5}{9}$  (which are $5, \\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{5}{9}$)\n- For $p=15$: $\\frac{15}{1}, \\frac{15}{3}, \\frac{15}{9}$ (which are $15, 5, \\frac{5}{3}$)\n\nStep 3: Collect all distinct positive rational roots.\nDistinct positive rational roots are: $\\{1, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{9}, 3, 5, \\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{5}{9}, 15\\}$.\nLet's order them to easily see distinct roots: $\\{\\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{5}{3}, 1, 3, 5, 15\\}$.\nThere are 8 distinct positive rational roots.\n\nStep 4: Include negative rational roots.\nFor each positive rational root $r$, $-r$ is also a possible rational root. Since we are looking for the number of different possible rational roots, we need to include both positive and negative roots.\nThe set of all possible rational roots is $\\{\\pm \\frac{1}{9}, \\pm \\frac{1}{3}, \\pm \\frac{5}{9}, \\pm \\frac{5}{3}, \\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15\\}$.\n\nStep 5: Count the total number of distinct rational roots.\nThere are 8 positive rational roots and 8 corresponding negative rational roots.\nTotal number of distinct rational roots is $8 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{16}$",
