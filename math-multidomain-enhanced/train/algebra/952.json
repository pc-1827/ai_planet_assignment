    "solution": "### Problem:\nFind the distance between the foci of the ellipse \\[x^2 + 4y^2 = 400.\\]\n\n### Original Solution:\nDividing by $400,$ we get \\[\\frac{x^2}{20^2} + \\frac{y^2}{10^2} = 1.\\]Thus, the length of the major and minor axes are $2 \\cdot 20 = 40$ and $2 \\cdot 10 = 20,$ respectively. Then the distance between the foci of the ellipse is $\\sqrt{40^2 - 20^2} = \\boxed{20\\sqrt3}.$\n\n### Improved Solution:\nTo find the distance between the foci of the ellipse $x^2 + 4y^2 = 400$, we first need to write the equation in the standard form of an ellipse centered at the origin, which is $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ for an ellipse centered at the origin with the major axis along the x-axis or y-axis.\n\nDivide both sides of the given equation by $400$ to obtain the standard form:\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{400} + \\frac{4y^2}{400} = \\frac{400}{400}\\]\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{400} + \\frac{y^2}{100} = 1\\]\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{20^2} + \\frac{y^2}{10^2} = 1\\]\nFrom the standard form, we identify $a^2 = 20^2 = 400$ and $b^2 = 10^2 = 100$. Thus, $a = 20$ and $b = 10$.\nSince $a > b$, the major axis is along the x-axis, and the semi-major axis length is $a = 20$, and the semi-minor axis length is $b = 10$.\nThe distance from the center to each focus, denoted by $c$, is related to $a$ and $b$ by the formula $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$.\nSubstituting the values of $a^2$ and $b^2$, we have:\n\\[c^2 = 20^2 - 10^2 = 400 - 100 = 300\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $c = \\sqrt{300} = \\sqrt{100 \\cdot 3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe foci are located at $(\\pm c, 0) = (\\pm 10\\sqrt{3}, 0)$.\nThe distance between the foci is $2c = 2 \\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = 20\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{20\\sqrt{3}}$",
