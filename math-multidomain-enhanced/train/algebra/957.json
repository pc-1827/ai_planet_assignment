    "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given a polynomial equation of degree 4:\n\\[x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0\\]\nwhere the coefficients $b, c, d, e$ are all integers. We are asked to find all possible values for $n$, the exact number of integer roots of this polynomial, counting multiplicity.\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- Polynomial: $x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0$\n- Coefficients: $b, c, d, e \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n- $n$: Number of integer roots (counting multiplicity)\n- Goal: Find all possible values of $n$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will analyze the possible number of integer roots. Since the polynomial is of degree 4, the number of roots (counting multiplicity) is 4. The number of integer roots $n$ can be any integer from 0 to 4. We need to determine which of these values are possible for a polynomial with integer coefficients. We will use the Integer Root Theorem and Vieta's formulas to analyze the constraints. We will try to construct examples for possible values of $n$ and prove that the impossible values are indeed impossible.\n\n**Relevant Theorems:**\n- **Integer Root Theorem:** If a polynomial $P(x) = x^k + a_{k-1}x^{k-1} + \\dots + a_1x + a_0$ has integer coefficients $a_{k-1}, \\dots, a_0$, then any integer root of $P(x) = 0$ must be a divisor of the constant term $a_0$.\n- **Vieta's Formulas:** For a polynomial $x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)(x-r_4)$, the sum of the roots is $r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4 = -b$, the sum of products of roots taken two at a time is $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_1r_4 + r_2r_3 + r_2r_4 + r_3r_4 = c$, the sum of products of roots taken three at a time is $r_1r_2r_3 + r_1r_2r_4 + r_1r_3r_4 + r_2r_3r_4 = -d$, and the product of the roots is $r_1r_2r_3r_4 = e$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nWe consider possible values of $n$ from 0 to 4.\n\nCase 1: $n = 0$.\nExample: $x^4 + 1 = 0$. This polynomial has integer coefficients. The roots are $x = e^{i(\\pi/4 + k\\pi/2)}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$. These are $e^{i\\pi/4}, e^{i3\\pi/4}, e^{i5\\pi/4}, e^{i7\\pi/4}$, which are not integers. So $n=0$ is possible.\n\nCase 2: $n = 1$.\nConsider $P(x) = (x - 1)(x^3 + 2) = x^4 - x^3 + 2x - 2$. The coefficients are integers. $x = 1$ is an integer root. For $x^3 + 2 = 0$, $x = -\\sqrt[3]{2}$, which is not an integer. Thus, there is exactly one integer root, $x = 1$. So $n = 1$ is possible.\n\nCase 3: $n = 2$.\nConsider $P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x^2 + 1) = (x^2 - 3x + 2)(x^2 + 1) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 3x^2 - 3x + 2$. The coefficients are integers. The integer roots are $x = 1, 2$. The roots of $x^2 + 1 = 0$ are $x = \\pm i$, which are not integers. So $n = 2$ is possible.\nAnother example with multiplicity: $P(x) = (x + 3)^2 (x^2 + 1) = (x^2 + 6x + 9)(x^2 + 1) = x^4 + 6x^3 + 10x^2 + 6x + 9$. Integer coefficients. Integer root $x = -3$ with multiplicity 2. So $n=2$ is possible.\n\nCase 4: $n = 3$.\nAssume that there are 3 integer roots, $r_1, r_2, r_3$. Let the fourth root be $r_4$.\nFrom Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 = -b$. Since $b, r_1, r_2, r_3$ are integers, the sum $r_1 + r_2 + r_3$ is an integer, and $-b$ is an integer. Therefore, $r_4 = -b - (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)$ must be an integer.\nThis means if there are 3 integer roots, the fourth root must also be an integer. Therefore, it is impossible to have exactly 3 integer roots. So $n = 3$ is impossible.\n\nCase 5: $n = 4$.\nConsider $P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = x^4 - 10x^3 + 35x^2 - 50x + 24$. The coefficients are integers, and the roots are $1, 2, 3, 4$, which are all integers. So $n = 4$ is possible.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $n$ are $0, 1, 2, 4$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe possible values of $n$ are $0, 1, 2, 4$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0,1,2,4}$",
